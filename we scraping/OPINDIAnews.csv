The BJP’s district vice-president’s murder comes ahead of the first phase of polling in the state.Chhattisgarh | A BJP leader (Ratan Dubey) was murdered today in the insurgency-hit Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh, said Bastar Range IG Sundarraj P. On being asked about Naxal involvement, the IG said that a team has been dispatched to the location and anything in this…Ratan Dubey, who was a member of the Narayanpur Zilla Panchayat, had come to Kaushalnar village to campaign for BJP candidate Kedar Kashyap who is contesting against Congress’s Chandan Kashyap. Dubey was first shot and then attacked with sharp weapons, including axes and daggers, in the Dhaudai region after addressing a poll rally.According to a Times of India report, after the campaign, a cockfight was held near the dais, and a large crowd gathered around it. The Maoist attackers, disguised as villagers, moved away from the gathering and began approaching the dais. Ratan Dubey, however, soon recognised them, got off the dais and started running. The ruckus diverted everyone’s attention away from the cockfight to see Dubey being pursued by several men wielding firearms, daggers, and axes. The chase continued for a few hundred metres until one of the perpetrators shot Ratan Dubey in the back. As an injured Dubey fell on the ground, the Maoist assailants attacked him with axes and daggers.Notably, Ratan Dubey’s murder came just ten days after the Maoists issued a threat to political candidates and their supporters “not to come seeking votes in Bastar.”In a statement on Saturday, Sundarraj P, Inspector General of police of Bastar range said, “At around 05:30 pm, Dubey had gone to Kaushalnar village, about 5km east from Jhargati police station, for campaigning, when he was attacked and killed with a sharp weapon by unidentified Maoists. After receiving information about the incident, police and security forces were sent to the spot, and the deceased’s body is being brought to the district headquarters at Narayanpur.”Later in the evening, the mortal remains of Ratan Dubey were brought to the District Hospital in Narayanpur.#WATCH | The mortal remains of BJP leader Ratan Dubey who was murdered today in the insurgency-hit Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh was brought to the District Hospital in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur. https://t.co/ibZF2HBsIX pic.twitter.com/DBiVQmMggPMeanwhile, Chhattisgarh BJP in-charge Om Mathur said, “While Ratan Dubey was chairing a meeting with the party workers in an interior village, was attacked by the Naxals.

2,"4 November, 2023 ",“I don’t expect votes from Miya Muslims”: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma says he is focused on development of all," The Assam Chief Minister further said that the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had a ""vote relationship"" with the Miya Muslim community in Assam and that votes have been obtained from them over the years by fostering an ""atmosphere of fear.""On Saturday (3rd November), Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that he does not expect Miya Muslims (East Bengal origin Muslims) to vote for him and the BJP. He added that he only expects the indigenous Assamese Muslims to vote for him. It is worth noting here that Miyas are Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims who settled in Assam coming from present-day Bangladesh.During a media interaction in Guwahati CM Sarma said, “I don’t expect votes from Miya Muslims. I don’t visit medical colleges because Miya Muslims are there in more numbers.”CM Sarma reportedly added that his government is primarily focused on the development and welfare of the indigenous Muslims of Assam. “I never expect votes from Muslims, except the indigenous Muslims from Assam. It is very sad that Miya Muslims are more than our indigenous youth in every medical college. I have stopped going much to these colleges now,” the Assam CM said.The Assam Chief Minister further said that the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had a “vote relationship” with the Miya Muslim community in Assam and that votes have been obtained from them over the years by fostering an “atmosphere of fear.”“Both parties have a relationship with Muslims of migrant origin until they get votes, but they have not taken any steps for their development or in the areas where they live,” Sarma reportedly said, adding that no roads, bridges, schools, or colleges have been built for them.FLASH: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday said he does not expect votes from 'Miya Muslims'. Addressing the media in Guwahati, Himanta Sarma further stated that his primary focus is on the well-being and progress of the indigenous Muslim population in Assam.… pic.twitter.com/pAWqg9aI30“As a first step, we have taken measures to improve the living conditions of the indigenous Assamese Muslims and a survey will be conducted soon on them,” continued.However, despite not expecting electoral support from the Miya Muslims, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma clarified that his government is dedicated to providing various government schemes to benefit all residents, including the Miya Muslim community.He said that Miya Muslims have the best days under the BJP government, as the govt undertakes all development activities for them without expecting to get votes. The CM added that if Congress or AIUDF does something for them, they will count how many votes they got in which booth in the area.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma made the comments replying to a question in a press conference he had held to give updates on several major infrastructure projects in the state, including tunnel under Brahmaputra, Kaziranga National Park elevated road and Guwahati ting road.On the other hand, AIUDF chief Maulana Badruddin Ajmal and Dhubri MP while responding to CM Sarma’s comments said that not having Miya Muslims to work would culminate in a deserted Guwahati. “If Miya Muslims do not work for three days in Guwahati, it will turn into a graveyard,” Ajmal said.Notably, Badruddin Ajmal had recently sparked controversy after saying that Muslims are “number 1” when comes to crimes like robbery, rape, murder, eve teasing and also on top in going to jail. He also said that while others are reaching the moon, Muslims are doing PhD on how to go to jail.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

3,"4 November, 2023 ","Gujarat: AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava absconding after assaulting forest dept staff and threatening with gun for removing encroachment, wife and PA arrested"," AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava summoned forest department staff to his residence for a discussion on encroachment of forest land by farmers, but he physically assaulted them and fired a shot in the air demanding that they should pay the farmers AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava from Dediapada in the Narmada district of Gujarat was booked in a case of assault by the police following a complaint filed by the forest department. It is alleged that the MLA called forest department employees to his residence, where the AAP leader is accused of threatening and physically assaulting the individuals. Subsequently, the police apprehended his wife, PA, and another individual after the FIR was lodged. However, MLA Chaitar Vasava is currently evading authorities, with his phone reportedly switched off.Narmada district police chief Prashant Sumbe has provided additional information on the incident. Per his statement, in a village in Dediapada, certain farmers had unlawfully occupied forest department land and initiated farming activities. Upon the department’s intervention to remove the encroachment, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Chaitar Vasava summoned the forest department staffers to his residence for a discussion, where the entire episode occurred.Providing further elaboration, the officer stated that certain farmers had encroached upon forest department land for farming, prompting the department’s removal of the encroachment on 29th October. Subsequently, Dediapada MLA Chaitar Vasava invited the forest department staff members to his residence to discuss the issue. On the evening of 30th October, the staff members arrived at the MLA’s residence.According to the police officer’s statement, during the incident, the MLA allegedly got into a scuffle with the forest employees, physically assaulting them. The MLA reportedly threatened them and asked to provide money to the farmers and also threatened to kill the employees if they did not comply. Additionally, the police officer revealed that the AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava discharged a round in the air using a firearm during the altercation.On the following day, Chaitar Vasava’s personal assistant (PA) allegedly contacted the forest department employees once more, pressuring them to provide money to the farmers. Subsequently, later that evening, the employees reportedly handed over the money to one of the farmers. However, the forest staff members eventually approached the police with these developments.The police officer further said, “A case was registered on the basis of a complaint from the forest department after the matter came to our notice. A case of rioting, assault on a public servant, and extortion was booked. Additionally, sections of the Arms Act were also included.”Apart from Chaitar Vasava, a case was also registered against his wife, PA and the farmer. MLA’s wife Shakuntala Ben, PA Jitendrabhai and farmer Rameshbhai have been arrested. The MLA has now gone underground and is being searched by the Narmada police. Police have said that they will complete the legal proceedings very soon and conduct further investigation.It is worth mentioning that no kind of cultivation can be done on the land of the Forest Department without the permission of the government. Despite the earlier instructions, some farmers had grown the crop, due to which the forest department was forced to take action.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

4,"4 November, 2023 ",Infighting continues in MP Congress unit: 39 leaders expelled for contesting against party’s official candidates," A few of the prominent names expelled from the Congress party’s primary membership include former MP Premchand Guddu (Alot), former MLA Antar Singh Darbar (Mhow), former MLA Yadvendra Singh (Nagod), state party spokesman Ajay Singh Yadav (Khargapur), Nasir Islam (Bhopal North) and Amir Aqueel (Bhopal North).On 4th November (Saturday), the Madhya Pradesh Congress functionary announced that the state unit has expelled 39 leaders from the party’s primary membership for six years. According to the party functionary, they have been expelled for contesting the upcoming state assembly elections against the party’s official candidates. According to a release issued by the party’s state vice-president Rajiv Singh, these 39 leaders were expelled from the Congress on the directives of the party’ state unit chief Kamal Nath.The release added that these expelled leaders are contesting elections either as independent candidates or on the ticket of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).A few of the prominent names expelled from the Congress party’s primary membership include former MP Premchand Guddu (Alot), former MLA Antar Singh Darbar (Mhow), former MLA Yadvendra Singh (Nagod), state party spokesman Ajay Singh Yadav (Khargapur), Nasir Islam (Bhopal North) and Amir Aqueel (Bhopal North).The development comes at a time when Congress is at loggerheads with one of its major alliance partners in the I.N.D.I. bloc. The discord which has only worsened with each passing day erupted after disputes arose over the seat-sharing formula in the poll-bound state. Initially, Congress and its I.N.D.I. alliance partner Samajwadi Party were reportedly in talks that the latter could be given six seats to contest in the state elections. However, when Congress announced candidates on assembly constituencies of sitting SP MLAs in MP, a war of words erupted with SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav accusing Congress of ‘betrayal’. Targeting the Congress party, Former UP CM Yadav asserted that Congress is demanding a nationwide caste census only for political benefit. He remarked that the fact that Congress is now requesting a caste census is a ‘miracle.’ The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister emphasised that the grand old party has come to the realisation that voters in backward areas do not support them.Apart from verbal exchanges and jibes, SP also fielded its candidates on 31 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh adding woes to its “alliance” partner Congress. Voting in Madhya Pradesh will take place a fortnight later on 17th November for the 230-seat Madhya Pradesh assembly while the result will be announced on 3rd December. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

5,"1 November, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan, Samantha Power, George Soros, the ‘democracy in danger’ and ‘genocide’ cries: A potential regime change op?"," Power's meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan has created a buzz in India. Why Uzbekistan? Why now, especially when the assembly elections fever is at its peak? We do not have the answers. However, now that the Central Asian country is in the spotlight, let me share about someone else who was in Uzbekistan on official business. Samantha Power, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), was there on October 23-24 to preside over the C5+1 Regional Connectivity Ministerial.Samantha Power has an impressive resume – a war correspondent for several publications including The Economist, an author, a government official and a diplomat. Her notable work, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2003. In that book, Power meticulously chronicled a century’s worth of American inaction in the face of massacres. The book inspired the ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine, emphasising that the United States and other nations bear a moral obligation to safeguard persecuted or threatened populations worldwide.Samantha Power boasts a significant history of association with Barack Obama, dating back to his days as a senator. Her journey alongside him began as a foreign policy fellow in 2005-06 in his senatorial office. She further played a pivotal role as a foreign policy adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign. However, she encountered controversy during this time when she referred to Hillary Clinton as ‘a monster’ during an interview, which she thought was an off-record comment, leading to her resignation from the campaign.In late November 2008, as the Obama administration took shape, Power was in the State Department transition team. She was appointed the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights on the National Security Council, serving from January 2009 to February 2013. She spearheaded the creation of a White House task force called the Atrocities Prevention Board – an interagency body to focus on emerging human rights crises before they escalated to the level of genocide. She was its inaugural chairperson. Power’s long-standing association with Obama underscores her involvement in shaping the US foreign policy of the Obama era. She is considered a key figure in persuading President Obama to militarily intervene in Libya; something that Obama considers as the worst decision of his Presidency. Thanks to her unwavering belief in the United States’ responsibility to prevent or alleviate the suffering of civilians in foreign nations, she earned nicknames such as the Ivy League Joan of Arc and Activist-in-Chief.According to The New Yorker, “When she entered the White House, at the age of thirty-eight, she had already established a reputation as a kind of Joan of Arc for humanitarian intervention.” The same article also mentions that while Obama welcomed her advocacy, she used to get on his nerves and that during a meeting to discuss Syria, Obama snapped, “We’ve all read your book, Samantha.” In February 2013, she left the National Security Council. In June of that year, Obama appointed her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. In a 2014 article, The New Yorker stated that unlike Vice President Joe Biden, and others who had risen through the foreign-policy establishment, Power favoured aligning the United States with citizen-led movements.Power was on TIME’s influential 100 list in 2015 (also in 2004), where she was referred to as the ‘new conscience of the US foreign policy establishment’ by Madeline Albright in a tribute titled Enemy of despots. She has been a big advocate of greater interference in the internal affairs of other nations, even military interventions, to defend humanitarianism. Given her openness to military interventions in Libya, Syria and Yemen, she has been often criticised for wanting to solve ‘problems from hell’ by using ‘solutions from hell’. In December 2014, she told The New Yorker, “As time wears on, I find myself gravitating more and more to the GSD people… (‘get shit done’, a term favoured by Susan Rice). Principles and positions only take you so far.”In January 2021, Joe Biden nominated Power to head the USAID.Power’s husband, Cass Robert Sunstein, is a professor and author and was also a part of the Obama administration. His views on ‘Mission LiFE’ were featured by Niti Aayog as well as included in the collection of views published by the Press Information Bureau.Power’s meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.In a March 2011 article on Samantha Power in The New York Times, Kenneth Roth, the then-Executive Director of Human Rights Watch called her “the foremost voice for human rights within the White House, and she has Obama’s ear.” The views of Roth or HRW on India are well, not so great.A more intriguing aspect of Power’s life is her perceived proximity to Henry Kissinger, known for his strong stance against India, as well as with the much-discussed George Soros. Both Kissinger and Soros were present at an exclusive gathering in SoHo on 31 May 2016, to celebrate the publication of a book by Cass Sunstein. A week later, on 8 June, Power received the 2016 Henry A. Kissinger Prize from the man himself. Interestingly, Power had strongly criticised Kissinger’s bloody, anti-human rights record in two of her books, including the Pulitzer Prize winner.Three years before that, in November 2013, when Soros received the top honour at the International Rescue Committee Benefit, Bill Clinton and Samantha Power both lauded him. Samantha Power on Soros: “My first introduction to George was indirect. I met (the late humanitarian) Fred Cuny and heard him describe how he and his patron George Soros were going to single-handedly break the siege of Sarajevo. Humble guys, I thought, modest in ambition. Little did I know.”Six years after that award night, in November 2019, Power tweeted this in response to Hungary kicking out Soros’ Central European University.In a September 2019 interview featured in The Guardian, Samantha Power’s new memoir, The Education of an Idealist, is described as having a broader aim: a call to action during a time of despair, as Donald Trump lays siege to what is left of the liberal order at home and abroad. She expressed her desire for readers to get a renewed sense of agency after reading her book and feel empowered to address the pressing problems around them. She also shared her plan to campaign for the Democratic cause in swing states.Power was in India from 25-27 July 2022. On the 26th, she met with civil society representatives to discuss freedom of expression, speech, identity, and the importance of protecting the rights of minority groups and underscored the continued commitment of the US to work with civil society organisations to advance human rights and fundamental freedoms. Then, on the 27th, addressing an event at IIT Delhi, Power said: “The headwinds against democratic rule are strong the world over. Within the United States and India, there are forces who seek to sow division, who seek to pit ethnicities and religions against one another, who wish to bend laws, abuse institutions and wield violence against those who stand in their way; we saw this, of course, on January 6 in the United States last year…” “But ultimately, what has positioned India as a future development leader has not been its assets but its values… It has been India’s multi-ethnic, multi-party democracy that has allowed it to withstand the challenges… It has been its support for free expression over decades that has allowed injustices to come to light. It has been its tolerance for diversity and dissent that has allowed reforms to take hold and institutions to progress. India’s trajectory has been so strong because – not in spite of – its democracy.”The Telegraph editorial on the 29th read: “While referencing Nehru and M.K. Gandhi, she (Power) did not mention Mr Modi even once. This was no oversight. Instead, it was a nudge to India to clear the shadow hovering over its commitment to its historical values. But a friend can only hold up a mirror. It is New Delhi that needs to look within.”On the 27th, Samantha Power also granted an interview to the NDTV’s Maha Siddiqui. Towards the interview’s conclusion, Siddiqui cited Power’s journalistic background to inquire about her perspective on the declining state of press freedom in India, even referencing a case involving a ‘fact checker.’ While Power refrained from explicit criticism, she expressed her viewpoint in a rather verbose manner by highlighting that India’s strength is rooted in healthy debate and criticism and emphasising that President Biden staunchly supports the cause of press freedom.Rewind to November 2010. During his visit to India, President Obama visited the first-ever Expo on Democracy and Open Government on the 7th in Mumbai. The event also marked the launch of the United States-India Open Government Dialogue, aimed at promoting government transparency and greater citizen engagement. It was led by the United States Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and the Adviser to the Prime Minister of India, Sam Pitroda.Incidentally, Chopra considers Pitroda, his father’s peer, as his inspiration. In November 2020, Chopra was named a member of one of the Joe Biden Presidential Transition Agency Review Teams to support transition efforts. Apart from Pitroda and Chopra, other Americans present for the event were Tom Vilsack (Agriculture Secretary, then and now), Samantha Power and Rajiv Shah (then Administrator USAID, now President of the Rockefeller group). At the end of the expo, Samantha Power read out a statement that ended with, “…we announced at today’s expo an initial commitment of approximately $1m to support the work of Indian civil society in sharing their best practices abroad, with a matching commitment of in-kind assistance by Sam Pitroda that will harness India’s technical expertise to assist governments in harnessing technology, improving services, and enhancing democratic accountability. This is precisely the kind of “partnership built on shared values” that President Obama has hailed during his visit to India.” Sunita Vishwanath (Hindus for Human Rights) was a panellist in the ‘India on the Brink: Preventing Genocide’ conference, a three-day virtual event organised from 26-28 February 2022 to ‘condemn looming genocide of Indian Muslims’. The participants’ list was big, and the conference was duly covered by The Wire. On a side note, Vishwanath was awarded a ‘Champions of Change’ award in July 2015, by the Obama Administration.There has been a consistent rise in the media article titles that talk about India being on the brink.Not to mention, the Gandhi dynasty scion, who never misses an opportunity to talk about erosion or collapse of Indian democracy when abroad.India ranks 8th among the countries that are at the highest risk for mass killing in a ranking given by the America-based Early Warning Project (EWP). The EWP has consistently assessed India as high risk since 2017–18, including second rank in 2021-22. Imagine the world’s largest democracy is assessed to have a higher chance of mass killings than Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Zimbabwe, … EWP, by the way, uses the V-Dem dataset, and V-dem is funded by Soros. (Damn!)Now, amidst the democracy in danger and genocide cries, consider these:In the lead-up to India’s 2024 general election, the spectre of foreign interference is undeniable. India’s pivotal role in the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy is well-established. However, it becomes complicated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolute stand in safeguarding Indian strategic interests and his refusal to succumb to Western pressure. The United States would rather support a candidate who has expressed implicit or explicit openness to Western intervention. There is a realisation that Modi and the BJP are going to win, but that will not deter external players from attempting to weaken Modi, even if there is no chance of defeating him. Against this backdrop, the timing of Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Uzbekistan coinciding with Samantha Power’s visit raises intriguing questions. Is it a mere coincidence, or is it a ‘power’ful signal of what may be on the horizon?This article was first published on the author’s blog and has been reproduced here with the author’s permission.

6,"1 November, 2023 ","The Hindu’s English Magazine ‘FrontLine’ and its Editor decide to officially be Hamas-collaborators: The shameful justification of rape, torture and beheading"," This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War. The Hindu’s fortnightly magazine ‘Frontline’ has now officially taken a stand justifying and whitewashing the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israel’s civilian population on the 7th of October 2023. In an ‘editors note’ published on the 30th of October, FrontLine essentially responded to why it refuses to condemn Islamic terror outfit Hamas. This ‘Frontline’ perhaps felt the need to justify its support to terror after the Israeli Ambassador to India had written a scathing open letter to The Hindu for interviewing Mousa Abu Marzouk – a Hamas official. The Editor of Frontline, Vaishna Roy, took to X to share the despicable note that she penned in the magazine. Editor’s Note: ""When one hears Israeli leaders use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies and accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play."" @frontline_india https://t.co/tj5XXdgX1XThe note by Roy essentially starts by insinuating that the Jews, who were the victims of the Holocaust, have now morphed into the perpetrators of the same atrocities against other people – Palestinians. Roy writes, “When one hears Israeli leaders repeatedly use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies, repeatedly accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, repeatedly claim that their powerhouse of a nation is the victim, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play. The Zionists have taken their generational rage and turned it not against the powerful West, whose arms and support they need, but against the hapless people on whose lands they have settled”.At the very outset, Roy sets the base to justify the terrorism that claimed the lives of women, children and the elderly on the 7th of October 2023 when Hamas, for over 8 hours, went on a rampage of unbridled violence against the Israeli civilian population. Not only does she equate the victims – the Jews – to the perpetrators of their genocide – the Nazis, but also insinuates that anti-semitism is a figment of their imagination – a sentiment of absolute hate the world has seen play out during various “protest marches” by Muslims, chanting for the annihilation of Jews. The crafty insinuation which was far more telling was her snicker at the fact that a “powerhouse of a nation” can ever claim to be the victim. Essentially what Roy was saying is that because Israel is financially and militarily far superior to several nations across the world, it can never claim itself to be the victim of terrorism. Perhaps it would help Roy to understand how terrorism works. Powerful nations with economic and military might win wars owing to that power, however, wars like the one Israel is fighting are generally ‘after the fact’. Terrorist groups and terror nations don’t particularly stick to rules of engagement, international conventions and military ethics. They are human bombs whose sole aim is to inflict damage, for the sake of their vengeful God. What makes them far more dangerous is that death in the process of fighting these “powerful nations”, which are viewed to be the enemies of their fanatic religious campaign, is in itself a reward by their God. When a “powerful nation” is faced with religious mercenaries for whom death itself is a religious reward by God himself, and the worst atrocities against innocent people a not only a tool to achieve that reward but also ordained by their scripture, the “powerful nation” and their people are the victims – notwithstanding their economic or military might. Essentially, the asymmetrical battle is between an all-powerful nation and an all-powerful, vengeful God – a claim by Roy’s mythical ‘victims’ themselves. The ‘all-powerful nation’ is bound by the rules of a civilised nation. Those who fight for an ‘all-powerful God’ adhere to no rules of the civilised world. They adhere to the rules set by their all-powerful God – a God which allows them, nay, ordains them, to murder those who don’t believe in him in the most brutal way known to man. A modern powerful nation is no match to those who believe in a medieval religious war. They never were. They never will be. Europe, which prided itself on being the birthplace of modernity and at one point ruled the entire world is learning this lesson bit by bit – the lessons are brutal, bloody and excruciating – a pain that, according to the ‘faithfuls’, they are destined to endure. Vaishna Roy wants Israelis to die with a smile on their face because they are rich, being murdered by those perceived to be poor – that is not how the world works – except in a communist’s deranged head. Roy in her note counts the dead bodies and compares those lost by Israel and Palestine. She writes, “Yom Kippur, 1973, saw 2,700 Israeli deaths and 19,000 Arab/Palestinian deaths. In the First Lebanon War, the numbers were 1,200 and 20,000. First Intifada: 179 and 1,200; Second Intifada: 900 and 3,300. The four Gaza Wars: 144 Israeli deaths and 4,800 Palestinian deaths. As this goes to press, the corresponding numbers for the ongoing war are 1,400 and 7,300, respectively. Hamas has stones, homemade rockets, tractors, and motorcycles. Israel has the world’s most sophisticated weapons. Israel is a nuclear nation while the Palestinians barely have a nation. Wasn’t it Voltaire who said killing is a crime unless you “kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets”?”What Roy writes here summarily exposes how she has, summarily, decided to be an ally of Islamic Jihad. The Yom Kippur War, for example, was a surprise attack by the Arab-Egypt coalition. It is also known as the Ramadan war because the ‘faithfuls’ believe it is their religious duty to fight and kill the infidels and that holy war, becomes a bit sweeter if the death and destruction are caused on the non-believer’s religious observance day. That Israel was simply better at mounting an offensive, causing more casualties to those who started the war, does not take away from the fact that they were the ones who were attacked. What is far more telling is that Roy even counts the deaths during the Intifadas. The Intifadas were, again, religious wars where the riots and violence were initiated by the Jihadis and sustained by them as well. During the first four years of the Intifada, more than 3,600 Molotov cocktail attacks, 100 hand grenade attacks and 600 assaults with guns or explosives were reported by the Israel Defense Forces. The violence was directed at soldiers and civilians alike. During this period, 16 Israeli civilians and 11 soldiers were killed by Palestinians in the territories; more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 Israeli soldiers were injured. Approximately 1,100 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops.There was instigation from the mosques of Palestine to kill Jews, justification for the genocide of their people and everything that we see the world over when the innocent faithfuls decide to rise against the infidels. After the unbridled violence by Jihadis, Israel defended itself. That defence in itself becomes a reason for Roy to dismiss assertions of the Jews being the victims of Jihad. Vaishna Roy’s shameless apologia for Jihad becomes painfully obvious as she concludes her note. She writes the following: “We are being harangued to condemn Hamas, but Hamas was not begotten in a vacuum. It was born from the bloody union of broken promises and daily humiliations, settler violence and soldier atrocities. Hamas was midwifed when basic humanitarian values were aborted. When UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said exactly this, pointing to the “56 years of suffocating occupation” the Palestinian people have suffered, Israel called for his resignation”, she says. Before we dissect what she has written, let us recap how this war started – what happened on the 7th of October 2023. On the 7th, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. There are painful eyewitness accounts of women being raped, dismembered, burnt alive and tortured, There are testimonies of babies, and toddlers being burnt alive, dismembered, shot and killed. There are testimonies and documented evidence of the brutality that Hamas inflicted. Beheadings. Rapes. Murders. Tortures. Kidnappings and worse – amidst chants of Allahu Akbar. After the terror attack by Hamas, Israel decided to defend itself and unleashed its military might to ensure Hamas – a terrorist organisation – is wiped out. Israel was defending its citizens and also attempting to recover the hundreds of hostages that Hamas had taken. What is pertinent to remember here that Hamas knew this was a war they would not win. They knew that their treacherous attack would lead to Israel using its military might to ensure the hostages were freed and also, that Hamas was wiped off the face of the earth. They still chose to attack Israeli citizens because that is the zealotry that Holy Wars inspire among the followers of the all-powerful God. Vaishna Roy essentially says that the Jews are Nazis because they chose to retaliate after women, children, babies and the elderly were tortured by Islamic terrorists. In the same breath, she also says that her magazine will simply not condemn Hamas because their action is a result of oppression. The reduction of that is simple – Hamas has a right to rape, torture, and behead civilians because they have supposedly been oppressed. They should not be condemned, rather, their barbarity must be understood in context. The language of the victims, so to speak. However, when those being raped, tortured and beheaded decide to say “thus far and no further”, they automatically become Nazis deserving annihilation because any form of retaliation against the Jihadis is “collective punishment” which further victimises the very Jihadis who raped, tortured and beheaded to avenge the oppression that the rapists and murderers experienced, leading them to rape, behead and torture innocent civilians. Further, it is evident that Roy is not particlarly concerned about the lives of Palestinians. If she were, she would, ideally be, a voice against Hamas. Hamas is no friend of the Palestinians. They use Palestinians as human shields, especially children, make hundreds of kilometers of tunnels were civilians are not allowed to take shelter, use aid money to buy weapons and deprive the Palestinians of a normal life. Even if we choose to ignore that Palestinians themselves overwhelmingly support Hamas, if Roy was so concerned, she should be picking her pen up to fight against Hamas, not be their ally. This may seem like intellectual masturbation at best and harakiri at worst, however, it is far more sinister than one imagines – sinister beyond just the context of Israel and Palestine. The overarching and blanket classification of all Muslims as the perennially oppressed endorses their delusion that owing to this mythical oppression, they are allowed to carry out their blood lust for those who refuse to believe in their all-powerful God. Every atrocity, every act of violence, every beheading, every rape, every riot, every stone thrown, every molotov cocktail hurled, every woman stripped, every baby killed, every innocent tortured, every person dismembered is the “language of the oppressed” and therefore, is not only pardonable but even understandable, or worse, acceptable. This delusion of Hamas collaborators like Vaishna Roy puts every Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian, Parsi, Sikh etc at the risk of an impending genocide. This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War.

7,"28 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas war: How propaganda pieces in media are used to generate sympathy for Hamas while demonising Israel," As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quartersOn 7th of October, 2023, hundreds ot arms-wielding men, landed in Israel, as the people were celebrating Yom Kippur, the Jewish festival of repentance, confessions and forgiveness. The men belonged to Hamas (Harkat-ul-Muqawama al-Islamiya or Islamic Resistance Group), a group designated by many countries as a terror organisation and has officially claimed involvement in several terror acts in the region.The audacious attack left more than 1400 unsuspecting Israeli citizens dead, many wounded and over 200 were carried back to the Hamas-controlled areas of Gaza as hostages. Among the dead, were music lovers who were attending a concert for Peace, infants and kids, as per Israel Government, brutally beheaded and burned down.The world watched in horror as reports of common civilians, those who march around crying Islamophobia across the world, like the famous Latifa AbouChakra of UK (She has been hailed in the past as the face of Muslims persecuted by Europeans in Europe where she lives as a refugee, in the name of Islamophobia), were caught cheering up these inhuman killings fancifully calling these unprecedented and brutal killing Resistance or Intifada hailing it as a moment of triumph.Considering the population of Israel, the US called these killings on proportionate basis, a 9-11, many times over. The details are gory and too many, covered too widely across several media reports.What my objective here is not to repeat the gruesome details and broad silence of Muslims as far as condemning the heinous terror act is concerned. As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quarters, not among the uneducated and deprived, rather among the intellectuals and the privileged die down.With this those who stayed mum in the face of very human and instinctive outrage at the 7th of October killings in Israel, tried to find voice with a Hospital attack but it turned out to be a failed rocket attack by Hamas terrorist which caused the misguided missile land in the parking lot of the ill-fated hospital. This clever game of creating fake narrative has been going on for decades and may be centuries but this time, with the prevalence on unorganised media in democratised digital world, the lies were getting caught as quickly as they were floated.Noted journalist Tavleen Singh, a known Modi-critic, wrote attacking Hamas, and was hounded by islamists for that. The hospital attack, which the Hamas-sympathisers tried to use to counter the inhuman killings of 7th October, turned out to be their own doing and took the wind out of the neatly floated Palestine propaganda balloon.However, after initial dilli-dally, Indian National Congress came out with vague statement and then again went into silence. One would have thought that they have run out of their interest in a foreign event, given that elections are around in India. But then as if on cue, Priyanka Vadra tweeted, lamenting on deaths in Gaza, totally ignoring the first event which triggered this revenge violence of a recognised state against a recognised terror organisation.Then I read a piece in today’s (28th October, 2023, Indian Express) by Farah Naqvi, who is mentioned as independent writer and activist, much like Latifa Abouchakra of Britain. In her piece titled Amid Crisis, fear-mongering, she tries to rebut another piece by Yeshaya Rosenman,  a Jewish journalist. Farah Naqvi was incidentally also a member of National Advisory Council of Sonia Gandhi during Congress-led UPA Government, which was an unconstitutional body operating over the elected parliament of India with Sonia Gandhi as quasi-head of the Government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Farah Naqvi, is the daughter of a noted journalist, Saeed Naqvi. In the account of her father’s brush with Covid where he survived, getting oxygen, hospital bed and medical attention with struggle (many did not get and lost their lives too), she finds a place to mention Democracy index and other political points, about how things are wrong with India which eventually saved her father, in spite of pandemic which left a global devastation of hitherto unseen proportions. But then that is how intellectuals in India play. Politics come easy to them and gratitude comes with difficulty.Coming back to the current piece, she writes starting from taking the count of dead Palestinians. On the day when Palestinian death toll crossed 7000. This is based on the report given out by the Health Ministry of Hamas controlled Gaza. These casualty figures mentioned in the Indian Express article by Ms. Naqvi have been disputed by the US authorities. That notwithstanding, the dead in Ms Naqvi articles mention only Palestinians, totally ignoring 1400 dead Israelis. She mocks how in the words of the Jewish journalist, who has actually more stake in the conflict perpetrated by Hamas, War Crimes are moral actions, resistance is aggression and occupied and occupier are same-to-same. This is where it gets clever. She has in one sentence called the response of a sovereign state to the killing of her citizens by a terror-group- war crime, mass-manslaughter by the terror group as Resistance, and called the Jewish who were rehabilitated in their ancient lands by a UN mandate, after the sufferings and genocide in Hitler’s holocaust, as occupier. Now this is a brilliant propaganda piece for master-class in journalism.In his much acclaimed book, On Writing, Sol Stein gives a very interesting example with two news pieces. I quote them here. The first one read- Terence McNiece, 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.The same piece of news, when written by a smart journalist like Ms Naqvi would read as, again quoting Sol Stein, According to the testimony of her mother, Terrance McNiece wanted a bicycle more than anything in the world, but she couldn’t afford to buy one. Terence, age 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.Sol writes- Conflict can arise from a thwarted desire, but the desire must be planted here.Does this not explain the occupier-occupied narrative that Ms Naqvi, like all closet Islamist supremacists, are peddling? What can be a bigger, loftier and nobler desire than to be free, the desire to not be occupied. Only slight overlooking of the fact is needed, like Jews lived there centuries before the advent of Islam, that the First Temple was made around ten Centuries before Christ, and almost 15 centuries before the advent of Islam.She has a problem with the Jewish writer trying to superimpose the developments in the Middle-East on India, in terms of Hindus and Muslims of India. But is that not the reason that she has written this rebuttal, she, who technically has no skin in the game, against the person who has something personal at stake here. She has written it as a Muslim and not as an Indian. And I will tell you why- because her history of Al-Aqsa Mosque does not start with Jewish King Soloman but with the fairy tale of Islam, just as her history of Kashi Vishwanath does not start with Kashi being the oldest Hindu city, but it starts with Aurangzeb when after destruction of a very Arabic-Sounding Gyaan Vapi, Muslims went to Courts claiming it is their unalienable right to wash their hands and feet over the structure which Hindus consider their religious idol.The very article which she wrote to pooh-pooh the irrational fears of Yeshahaya, as far as Hindus in India are concerned, substantiates that fear, by the way she reports the terror attack, exposes that hatred that she has. It also underscores the point the Jewish journalist has made, she wants you to be unsuspecting, lulled into a false sense of security, the way Kashmiri Hindus were in the 90s, the Lahori Hindus were in 1946, the way Bengalis of Dhaka were in 1946, till such time that these fears come real.When quoting how the article ends with – If Congress leaders can not find within them a spine, they should remember that they still have a neck.- made her cringe, one wonder if Sar Tan Se Juda slogans coming out on the streets of Bharat made her cringe as much as to write a piece on it, like ever?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

8,"24 October, 2023 ","Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women"," Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

9,"23 October, 2023 ",The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth," The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Rest all is Fake.” He also tagged Disney+ Hotstar in the post. The channel has not released any official statement.The original campaign talks about the ICC Cricket World Cup being streamed for free on Disney+ Hotstar. However, the edited version of the video not only added campaign material in the video but also voiceover-ed the artists acting in the campaign with fake voices. At one point where Kartik says “Freddy main hi hun” to the female artist in the ad, the voiceover replaced the dialogue with “Arre main bhi to Congressi hun”.

12,"22 October, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts"," As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, in the party's flag, there is a yellow olive leaves symbol and the words 'Welfare Party' in the middle panelAs Israel continues its military action against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation to the horrific terror attack on Israel by Hamas, Islamists and leftists worldwide, who are traditionally anti-Israel, are protesting against Israel and in support of Hamas and Palestine. A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

15,"2 November, 2023 ","Israeli parliamentarian slams Rajdeep Sardesai for equating Hamas terror attack with Israel’s military action, says won’t allow govt to stop until Hamas is eliminated"," Boaz Bismuth made it clear that it is Israel's duty to protect its people and thus the country is entitled to end terrorism.On Wednesday (1st November) IndiaToday journalist Rajdeep Sardesai attempted to draw parallels between Israel’s retaliatory action in Gaza with Hamas’s terrorist attack in Israel on the 7th of October. Boaz Bismuth, an Israeli MP blasted Sardesai for drawing parallels between a terrorist attack and a country’s military action against terrorism.During his program on IndiaToday discussing Israel’s bombing of the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza on Wednesday Rajdeep asked, “There seems to be a dehumanisation taking place on both sides..”To this, the Israeli MP raised strong objection saying that he would not allow anyone to make parallels between Hamas’s terror attacks and Israeli war against terrorism. “A..If I (Israel) didn’t care about their lives, I wouldn’t send my planes and soldiers. B. I tell civilians to get out of the buildings (controlled by terrorists). C… terrorists are going under the hospitals because they know that I won’t attack a hospital. You interviewed the person who spoke about the hostages…she said also in Israel they have got thousands of people in their jails. Yes, we have terrorists, what do they have…six months babies,” the Israeli lawmaker said.After a failed attempt at guilt-tripping the Israeli representative, Rajdeep Sardesai asked him if the Hamas terrorists release the hostages, will there be a ceasefire from the Israeli side. In response to this, Boaz Bismuth made it clear that it is Israel’s duty to protect its people and thus the country is entitled to end terrorism.When asked if the same morality applies to the Palestinian children and if they too have the same rights as Israeli children, Bismuth reminded Sardesai that, unlike Hamas terrorists, Israeli forces are not entering Palestine and killing children. “Did you see my soldiers going and slaughtering Palestinian children…what are you talking about?”Sardesai was somehow trying to establish that in the war between Hamas and Israel, the Palestinian people are suffering. However, he conveniently forgot that it was the same Palestinian people who elected Hamas to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in the 2006 elections giving them 74 out of 132 seats despite knowing that it was a terrorist group in the barb of a ‘political party’. The Israeli lawmaker reminded Sardesai of the same and said, “In 2006 when they had elections, knowing that Hamas is a terrorist group, knowing that Hamas wants to eliminate Israel as a nation, knowing that Hamas wants to renew this Islamic Jihad…70 per cent of Gaza people voted for them. And although they did that Israel is not attacking civilians. Israel has nothing against civilians but has everything against terrorism.”I will not allow my government to stop until Hamas is over: @BismuthBoaz, Israel MP @sardesairajdeep #NewsToday pic.twitter.com/Qm32Nhgdl9Responding to Sardesai’s claims that over 5000 people have died in Palestine since the country declared war on Hamas, Boaz Bismuth called out the hypocrisy of how the world sees it when the West, the “civilised world” attacks terrorism and Israel does the same. He went on to explain how Israel’s war on Hamas is also a war of India, the US and any country that cares for the Palestinian people as he said: “If you really care for Palestinian people, you should eliminate a terrorist group like Hamas because who is behind what is happening in Gaza right now. Its Hamas! If they hadn’t come inside our villages, our houses and then we would never have responded like that..”Despite the Israeli lawmaker emphasising the necessity to uproot Hamas completely, Rajdeep Sardesai seemed keen on pushing for a ceasefire. In response, Bismuth reiterated that as not only an MP but also as a citizen he would not want his government to declare a ceasefire until Hamas is eliminated. He also reminded Sardesai that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has not yet condemned Hamas’s terrorist attacks that left 1400 Israelis including children and the elderly dead, and women raped. Highlighting the difference between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists, Boaz Bismuth said that when Hamas kills Israeli children, they celebrate, on the other hand, if somehow Palestinian children suffer due to Israeli action by mistake, the Israeli soldiers cry for those children. Sardesai wrapped the Gaza debate as the Israeli lawmaker and former journalist pointed out that Jews after getting their promised land focused on their welfare, technology medicines and other aspects while Hamas focused on terrorism.Interestingly, liberals, Islamists and Palestine sympathisers in general across the world have been pushing this narrative that Hamas is an armed ‘resistance’ group and that it is the innocent Palestinian civilians who are suffering atrocities while Hamas and Israel clash. However, several surveys conducted over the last few years, suggest that the Palestinian people overwhelmingly support the Islamist terrorist group Hamas. As per a survey released in 2021, Palestinian support for Hamas surged dramatically following the Gaza war in May of that year. As reported earlier, the scientific poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) found that around three-quarters of Palestinians viewed Hamas terrorists as victors in a battle against Israel.Similarly, in the 2019 PCPSR survey, it was found that if Palestinian presidential elections were to be held between President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, 41 per cent of Palestinians would vote for Haniyeh. 48 per cent of Palestinians expressed support for a two-state solution. In the 2018 PCPSR survey, 49 per cent of Palestinians said they would vote for Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh for President. A Washington Institute survey this year showed that 57 per cent of Gazans had a positive opinion of Hamas with similar percentages of Palestinians in the West Bank (52%) and East Jerusalem (64%).It is worth noting that while Palestine sympathisers like Rajdeep Sardesai and Hamas supporting Islamists globally are demanding a ‘ceasefire’, a top Hamas terrorist Ghazi Hamad not only justified the brutal terror attack in Israel on October 7 killing thousands of civilians including children and the elderly and raping women parading them naked but also announced to repeat it until Israel is annihilated completely.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

They also refused to condemn the Hamas leader addressing a rally in Kerala and went round and round in circles over the question.During the debate, Sardesai and other panellists consistently targeted Union Minister Rajiv Chandrashekhar, claiming he connected the Kerala blast at the convention centre to a Hamas rally. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla repeatedly clarified that the minister did not connect the dots as it was being claimed. Still, he drew parallels that such rallies and incidents point towards the possibility of radicalisation.Moving on, Congress spokesperson Lavanya Ballal Jain was questioned by Sardesai if the Congress party condemned the terrorist attack in Israel, what is happening in Gaza and the Solidarity Youth Movement rally that took place in Kerala where former Hamas chief Khaled Mashal addressed the crowd. Lavanya kept going round and round in her answer. Still, she neither condemned Hamas’ terror attack on Israel nor did she give a clear answer on Hamas’s leader addressing a rally in Kerala.""Attack on civilians/innocent people is against international law..it is a crime"": MK Muneer, Muslim League leader Should the rally be allowed where a Hamas leader was addressing? Answers @LavanyaBallal, Cong spokesperson#NewsToday #Kerala #Blasts | @sardesairajdeep pic.twitter.com/LyzIVLRPoQShe said that holding a rally is a fundamental right of every Indian. However, she pointed out that there has been no communal tension on record in Kerala for the past five years. She said there had been no communal tension, but “we are jumping to declare that Kerala is a Tinder Box. Kerala is becoming communally sensitive. Let’s also be very clear that there has been no communal violence in the state in the last five and a half years, and most of the communal violence incidents have happened in the Hindi speaking States, especially in the BJP ruled States.”Sardesai asked CPI(M) leader MA Baby how the rally by the Solidarity Youth Movement (SYM) was allowed when former Hamas chief Khaled Mashal addressed the crowd. SYM is the youth wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami organisation.In his reply, MA Baby cited freedom of speech and said any legal organisation is free to hold rallies for any cause, including for Palestinians or any other “liberation movement”. He further refused to acknowledge the contents of the speech by the Hamas leader and said whatever was being talked about in the media was just speculation over what he said. He further emphasised the fact that Hamas is not a banned organisation in India. He further asserted that it was unclear if there was any element of radicalisation in the speech.Notably, on 9th October, MA Baby extended his support for Hamas and said, “If you are labelling Hamas a terrorist organisation, then you will have to accept the fact that Israel also is a terrorist country. The time has come to declare Palestine as an independent country with eastern Jerusalem as its capital.” This statement was pointed out during the debate by BJP’s spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, who said it justified what Hamas did on 7th October.Denying calling Hamas a terrorist outfit, MA Baby said, “Hamas is now the elected representative of the Gaza region. They are part of the Palestinian Liberation Movement. They are the most influential organisation there. My party has differences about the approach of Hamas, but Hamas is one of the militant streams.”He further cited United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterrers’ statement where he said, “It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled, their people displaced, and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.”MA Baby used the statement to justify the Hamas terrorist attack on Gaza, saying even the UN justified it. However, he completely skipped on the fact that just a day after the statement, Guterres himself said his statement was misrepresented, and in no way was it justification for what Hamas did in Israel on 7th October.Sardesai questioned IUML leader ML Muneer if he unequivocally condemned what happened on 7th October. On that day, the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas initiated the largest terror attack on Israel, killing around 1,300 Israelis and foreigners, including children, elderly and women. Over 200 were taken hostage by Hamas.Replying to his question, Muneer asserted that whatever happened on 7th October was not out of the blue but a reaction to what had been happening to Palestinians for decades. Rooting for whataboutery, Muneer continued and said under international law, killing any civilians is against the law. However, “What Israel has done in retaliation to this, killed 7,000. Out of 7,000, 4,000 are children. Are they a member of Hamas?” Muneer echoed the same narrative that Hamas did not attack Israel in a vacuum during the debate.On 27th October, Khaled Mashal, the former chief of the terrorist organisation Hamas, virtually addressed a ‘solidarity event’ organised by the Solidarity Youth Movement. The group is the youth wing of the extremist Jamaat-e-Islami Hind outfit. The terrorist leader reportedly called for the annihilation of Hinduism and Zionism in his address. In his speech, Khalid asked people present at the rally to extend unconditional support to Hamas and made anti-Hindu comments. Anti-Hindu slogans were raised in the rally held in Malappuram, and the audience is heard applauding the address of Khaled Mashal playing on a large screen. They supported his call and vowed to support Hamas terrorists.On 7th October (local time), Hamas launched the worst terrorist attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,300 Israelis and foreign nationals, including children, the elderly and women. Over 200 people were taken hostage by the Hamas terrorists. Women were raped, children were killed in front of their parents, the elderly were shot dead point black in their homes, Israeli soldiers were killed, and the terrorists mutilated their bodies during the attack. Israel launched a counter-strike on Hamas. So far, around 8,000 lives have been lost in Israeli air strikes. Israel has warned the civilians multiple times to evacuate, but reports suggest that Hamas terrorists kept stopping them. Meanwhile, India launched Operation Ajay to rescue Indians from Israel. On 1st November, the Israel-Hamas war entered its 25th day.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

17,"1 November, 2023 ","The Hindu’s English Magazine ‘FrontLine’ and its Editor decide to officially be Hamas-collaborators: The shameful justification of rape, torture and beheading"," This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War. The Hindu’s fortnightly magazine ‘Frontline’ has now officially taken a stand justifying and whitewashing the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israel’s civilian population on the 7th of October 2023. In an ‘editors note’ published on the 30th of October, FrontLine essentially responded to why it refuses to condemn Islamic terror outfit Hamas. This ‘Frontline’ perhaps felt the need to justify its support to terror after the Israeli Ambassador to India had written a scathing open letter to The Hindu for interviewing Mousa Abu Marzouk – a Hamas official. The Editor of Frontline, Vaishna Roy, took to X to share the despicable note that she penned in the magazine. Editor’s Note: ""When one hears Israeli leaders use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies and accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play."" @frontline_india https://t.co/tj5XXdgX1XThe note by Roy essentially starts by insinuating that the Jews, who were the victims of the Holocaust, have now morphed into the perpetrators of the same atrocities against other people – Palestinians. Roy writes, “When one hears Israeli leaders repeatedly use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies, repeatedly accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, repeatedly claim that their powerhouse of a nation is the victim, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play. The Zionists have taken their generational rage and turned it not against the powerful West, whose arms and support they need, but against the hapless people on whose lands they have settled”.At the very outset, Roy sets the base to justify the terrorism that claimed the lives of women, children and the elderly on the 7th of October 2023 when Hamas, for over 8 hours, went on a rampage of unbridled violence against the Israeli civilian population. Not only does she equate the victims – the Jews – to the perpetrators of their genocide – the Nazis, but also insinuates that anti-semitism is a figment of their imagination – a sentiment of absolute hate the world has seen play out during various “protest marches” by Muslims, chanting for the annihilation of Jews. The crafty insinuation which was far more telling was her snicker at the fact that a “powerhouse of a nation” can ever claim to be the victim. Essentially what Roy was saying is that because Israel is financially and militarily far superior to several nations across the world, it can never claim itself to be the victim of terrorism. Perhaps it would help Roy to understand how terrorism works. Powerful nations with economic and military might win wars owing to that power, however, wars like the one Israel is fighting are generally ‘after the fact’. Terrorist groups and terror nations don’t particularly stick to rules of engagement, international conventions and military ethics. They are human bombs whose sole aim is to inflict damage, for the sake of their vengeful God. What makes them far more dangerous is that death in the process of fighting these “powerful nations”, which are viewed to be the enemies of their fanatic religious campaign, is in itself a reward by their God. When a “powerful nation” is faced with religious mercenaries for whom death itself is a religious reward by God himself, and the worst atrocities against innocent people a not only a tool to achieve that reward but also ordained by their scripture, the “powerful nation” and their people are the victims – notwithstanding their economic or military might. Essentially, the asymmetrical battle is between an all-powerful nation and an all-powerful, vengeful God – a claim by Roy’s mythical ‘victims’ themselves. The ‘all-powerful nation’ is bound by the rules of a civilised nation. Those who fight for an ‘all-powerful God’ adhere to no rules of the civilised world. They adhere to the rules set by their all-powerful God – a God which allows them, nay, ordains them, to murder those who don’t believe in him in the most brutal way known to man. A modern powerful nation is no match to those who believe in a medieval religious war. They never were. They never will be. Europe, which prided itself on being the birthplace of modernity and at one point ruled the entire world is learning this lesson bit by bit – the lessons are brutal, bloody and excruciating – a pain that, according to the ‘faithfuls’, they are destined to endure. Vaishna Roy wants Israelis to die with a smile on their face because they are rich, being murdered by those perceived to be poor – that is not how the world works – except in a communist’s deranged head. Roy in her note counts the dead bodies and compares those lost by Israel and Palestine. She writes, “Yom Kippur, 1973, saw 2,700 Israeli deaths and 19,000 Arab/Palestinian deaths. In the First Lebanon War, the numbers were 1,200 and 20,000. First Intifada: 179 and 1,200; Second Intifada: 900 and 3,300. The four Gaza Wars: 144 Israeli deaths and 4,800 Palestinian deaths. As this goes to press, the corresponding numbers for the ongoing war are 1,400 and 7,300, respectively. Hamas has stones, homemade rockets, tractors, and motorcycles. Israel has the world’s most sophisticated weapons. Israel is a nuclear nation while the Palestinians barely have a nation. Wasn’t it Voltaire who said killing is a crime unless you “kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets”?”What Roy writes here summarily exposes how she has, summarily, decided to be an ally of Islamic Jihad. The Yom Kippur War, for example, was a surprise attack by the Arab-Egypt coalition. It is also known as the Ramadan war because the ‘faithfuls’ believe it is their religious duty to fight and kill the infidels and that holy war, becomes a bit sweeter if the death and destruction are caused on the non-believer’s religious observance day. That Israel was simply better at mounting an offensive, causing more casualties to those who started the war, does not take away from the fact that they were the ones who were attacked. What is far more telling is that Roy even counts the deaths during the Intifadas. The Intifadas were, again, religious wars where the riots and violence were initiated by the Jihadis and sustained by them as well. During the first four years of the Intifada, more than 3,600 Molotov cocktail attacks, 100 hand grenade attacks and 600 assaults with guns or explosives were reported by the Israel Defense Forces. The violence was directed at soldiers and civilians alike. During this period, 16 Israeli civilians and 11 soldiers were killed by Palestinians in the territories; more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 Israeli soldiers were injured. Approximately 1,100 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops.There was instigation from the mosques of Palestine to kill Jews, justification for the genocide of their people and everything that we see the world over when the innocent faithfuls decide to rise against the infidels. After the unbridled violence by Jihadis, Israel defended itself. That defence in itself becomes a reason for Roy to dismiss assertions of the Jews being the victims of Jihad. Vaishna Roy’s shameless apologia for Jihad becomes painfully obvious as she concludes her note. She writes the following: “We are being harangued to condemn Hamas, but Hamas was not begotten in a vacuum. It was born from the bloody union of broken promises and daily humiliations, settler violence and soldier atrocities. Hamas was midwifed when basic humanitarian values were aborted. When UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said exactly this, pointing to the “56 years of suffocating occupation” the Palestinian people have suffered, Israel called for his resignation”, she says. Before we dissect what she has written, let us recap how this war started – what happened on the 7th of October 2023. On the 7th, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. There are painful eyewitness accounts of women being raped, dismembered, burnt alive and tortured, There are testimonies of babies, and toddlers being burnt alive, dismembered, shot and killed. There are testimonies and documented evidence of the brutality that Hamas inflicted. Beheadings. Rapes. Murders. Tortures. Kidnappings and worse – amidst chants of Allahu Akbar. After the terror attack by Hamas, Israel decided to defend itself and unleashed its military might to ensure Hamas – a terrorist organisation – is wiped out. Israel was defending its citizens and also attempting to recover the hundreds of hostages that Hamas had taken. What is pertinent to remember here that Hamas knew this was a war they would not win. They knew that their treacherous attack would lead to Israel using its military might to ensure the hostages were freed and also, that Hamas was wiped off the face of the earth. They still chose to attack Israeli citizens because that is the zealotry that Holy Wars inspire among the followers of the all-powerful God. Vaishna Roy essentially says that the Jews are Nazis because they chose to retaliate after women, children, babies and the elderly were tortured by Islamic terrorists. In the same breath, she also says that her magazine will simply not condemn Hamas because their action is a result of oppression. The reduction of that is simple – Hamas has a right to rape, torture, and behead civilians because they have supposedly been oppressed. They should not be condemned, rather, their barbarity must be understood in context. The language of the victims, so to speak. However, when those being raped, tortured and beheaded decide to say “thus far and no further”, they automatically become Nazis deserving annihilation because any form of retaliation against the Jihadis is “collective punishment” which further victimises the very Jihadis who raped, tortured and beheaded to avenge the oppression that the rapists and murderers experienced, leading them to rape, behead and torture innocent civilians. Further, it is evident that Roy is not particlarly concerned about the lives of Palestinians. If she were, she would, ideally be, a voice against Hamas. Hamas is no friend of the Palestinians. They use Palestinians as human shields, especially children, make hundreds of kilometers of tunnels were civilians are not allowed to take shelter, use aid money to buy weapons and deprive the Palestinians of a normal life. Even if we choose to ignore that Palestinians themselves overwhelmingly support Hamas, if Roy was so concerned, she should be picking her pen up to fight against Hamas, not be their ally. This may seem like intellectual masturbation at best and harakiri at worst, however, it is far more sinister than one imagines – sinister beyond just the context of Israel and Palestine. The overarching and blanket classification of all Muslims as the perennially oppressed endorses their delusion that owing to this mythical oppression, they are allowed to carry out their blood lust for those who refuse to believe in their all-powerful God. Every atrocity, every act of violence, every beheading, every rape, every riot, every stone thrown, every molotov cocktail hurled, every woman stripped, every baby killed, every innocent tortured, every person dismembered is the “language of the oppressed” and therefore, is not only pardonable but even understandable, or worse, acceptable. This delusion of Hamas collaborators like Vaishna Roy puts every Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian, Parsi, Sikh etc at the risk of an impending genocide. This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War.

The event has been hosted in association with ‘The National Centre for the Performing Arts’ (NCPA) .Hasan is infamous for his 2009 video where he was heard equating non-Muslims with ‘cattle’ and homosexuals with ‘paedophiles.’He was heard saying, “Once we lose the moral high ground we are no different from the rest, of the non-Muslims, from the rest of those human beings who live their lives as animals, bending any rule to fulfill any desire.”It must be mentioned that Mehdi Hasan is of Indian descent but was raised in England since childhood. Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin.

However, the US authorities have reportedly said that the 1,414 objects from different sources seem to be of “Indian provenance”.As per the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, antiquity is defined as “any coin, sculpture, painting, epigraph or other work of art or craftsmanship; any article, object or thing detached from a building or cave; any article, object or thing illustrative of science, art, crafts, literature, religion, customs, morals or politics in bygone ages; any article, object or thing of historical interest” that “has been in existence for not less than 100 years”.Non-antiquities are generally decorative objects and idols, or replicas of original art objects used for ornamental purposes.A joint investigation by The Indian Express in March revealed that a treasure trove at the Met was traced to antique dealer Subhash Kapoor, who was serving a prison term in Tamil Nadu for smuggling antiquities.On 22nd March, the Supreme Court of the State of New York had issued a warrant against the Met giving the authorities ten days to seize the antiquities.On 30th March, the Met had issued a statement saying it would “transfer 15 sculptures for return to the Government of India, after having learned that the works were illegally removed from India”. 10 of the 15 items in the search warrant were flagged in The Indian Express report.Earlier, in July, the Indian government had said the objects from the Met were expected to arrive in the next three to six months. 105 antiquities were handed over by the US authorities to the Indian Consulate in New York on 17th July, and repatriated to India in August.

20,"19 October, 2023 ",Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October," The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones. It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

22,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba"," Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The statue will be inaugurated by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday (November 7). On this occasion, the water of all the rivers on the Kanyakumari-Kashmir route will be collected and the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj will be anointed by it. The statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is installed along the Line of Control near Kupwara.Maharashtra’s Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Maharashtra’s Cultural Affairs Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and army officers will be present at the puja. Rajesh Kshirsagar, executive chairman of the Maharashtra State Planning Board, and Hemant Jadhav, president of ‘Amhi Punekar’ (We Punekars) NGO held a press conference to provide this information. Trustees of the institute including Abhayraj Shirole, Milind Pawar, and Akhil Jhanjale were present at this time.Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and the head of the Yedtore Mutt, Mysore – Sri Sri Shankar Bharathi Mahaswamiji are scheduled to attend the inauguration ceremony. The equestrian statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was flagged off from Mumbai Raj Bhavan to Kupwara on 20th October, accompanied by drum beats and chants of “Jai Bhavani Jai Shivaji”. Maharashtra Governor Ramesh Bais accompanied by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Minister of Cultural Affairs Sudhir Mungantiwar flagged off the statue. The statue completed a journey of approximately 2200 km before reaching Kupwara, where the soldiers extended an extraordinary welcome to the revered figure of the Maratha icon.

24,"4 November, 2023 ","Explained: What is Electoral Bonds Scheme, how it works, and why govt says it is essential to ensure transparency & white money in political funding"," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta warned that if the scheme is scrapped, it will result in the return to days of funding of parties by cash, which makes preventing black money flowing into the political system impossible.On 2 November, the Supreme Court of India asked the Election Commission of India to submit details of electoral bonds received by political parties, giving the poll panel 2 weeks to furnish the data. The order came in the hearing of petitions challenging the validity of electoral bonds. The Supreme Court of India started hearing the petitions on 31st October and reserved its judgement.The electoral bonds are used by donors to make financial contributions to political parties. The government of India issued a notification in 2018 launching electoral bonds for donations to the political parties. These bonds provide anonymity to the donors. One of the main aims behind launching the bonds was to eradicate the black money infusion into politics. The electoral bonds are issued by banks, which means the funds donated to political parties go through the banking system, even though the identity of the donor is not disclosed. Therefore, it ensures that only legitimate money is donated to parties. However, those who have filed petitions against such bonds claim that these bonds do not provide a level playing field to the political parties. It is claimed BJP corners the majority of bonds.On 2nd January 2018, the government of India introduced the Electoral Bond Scheme. The idea was to enhance the transparency in political funding and stop using black money in politics. The Electoral Bonds are interest-free bearer instruments that are available in various denominations. Indian citizens and incorporated Indian entities can buy these bonds from specific State Bank of India branches.As per the notification issued by the Government of India, one has to adhere to KYC norms to purchase Electoral Bonds. Once bought, these bonds have to be donated to registered political parties within a 15-day window. The purchase period for the bonds occurs in January, April, July and October. However, during General Elections, there is a provision for an additional 30-day extension period for purchasing and making donations to the political parties.The eligible political parties that receive donations via such bonds can encash the bonds through designated bank accounts. The donations through Electoral Bonds promote a more transparent and accountable system for political contributions.The name and other information of the donor are not men mentioned on the instrument and thus electoral bonds are said to be anonymous. But the party that receives the bonds knows who donated them, as they have to delivered physically. Is there a cap on the number of electoral bonds that a person or a company can purchase?As per the rules, there is no cap on the number of electoral bonds that a person or a company can purchase. These bonds are available in Rs 1,000, Rs 10,000, Rs 1 lakh, Rs 10 lakh, and Rs one crore denominations.To make it possible to use electoral bonds for donations, the Government of India brought amendments to four Acts via the Finance Act of 2016 and 2017. These Acts were the Representation of the People Act of 1951 (RPA), and the Companies Act, of 2013. The Income Tax Act, 1961. And the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA), through the Finance Acts of 2016 and 2017.Though there is no cap on the number of bonds someone can buy, no corporate company can make donations to more than 75 per cent of their total profit or 10 per cent of their total revenue in a single financial year.As per the regulations, the political parties that have secured at least 1 per cent votes in the recent Lok Sabha or State Assembly elections and are registered under the Representation of People’s Act can get a designated account from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to get the donations via electoral bonds. Once received, the political party can encase the amount within 15 days from the day the bonds were bought. In case the party fails to encash the bonds within the timeline, the money will get deposited in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.The Supreme Court has been hearing the arguments against the Electoral Bond Scheme. The pleas against the scheme have challenged its constitutionality. They have argued that this scheme is a potential threat to democracy in India. The key points in the arguments against the bonds included the violation of the right to information, the possibility of backdoor lobbying and the potential use of shell companies for donations to the political parties. Furthermore, the pleas raised concerns over the anonymity of the bonds and the promotion of corruption by protecting criminals from prosecution.The scheme’s critics have also raised concerns over the name “electoral bonds” as they claimed the money could be used by the political parties for any purpose as there are no specific spending limits. Furthermore, they argued that although the government has reduced the disclosure threshold of the donations, that might not reduce the use of cash in politics. For those who are unaware, those who donate any amount under Rs 20,000 are not obliged to disclose that they have donated to a political party. There have been demands to reduce the threshold further to Rs 2,000 to give more transparency to the political donations by individuals and corporations.One of the arguments that made headlines is the so-called uneven playing field. The critics have argued that since the scheme was launched, around 74 per cent of the donations via electoral bonds went to the ruling party, BJP. The other political parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress and others, received only a small portion of the total amount. They argued that it led to an uneven playing field as the BJP will have more money to spend on political campaigns.Additionally, as the scheme differentiates between corporate donors and individual citizens, the latter might have their voices overpowered by the former in democracy, which could be concerning.Another point that was raised is that the scheme is “unfair” to the donors as the political parties are not bound to disclose where they spent the donations received by electoral bonds. During the arguments, the Supreme Court also raised apprehensions about the possibility of trading of electoral bonds, though it is not allowed.In the end, it was contended that the main aim. However, the government suggested that to reduce the influence of black money was to “redirect non-anonymous funding from traditional banking channels to anonymous Electoral Bonds”, which essentially “created an alternative white money channel”, for the political funding. The critics claimed that these arguments collectively raised significant doubts about the impact of the scheme on political funding, transparency, and the integrity of the electoral process in India.The union government has rejected the arguments against the scheme, stressing that it is designed to bring transparency in funding of political parties. Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta said that there are enough safeguards built into the scheme. He noted that as parties are getting funds through the banking system, it means only clean money is donated to them. He warned that if the scheme is scrapped, it will result in the return to days of funding of parties by cash, which makes preventing black money into the political system impossible.He explained that the scheme has various measures to ensure transparency, such as the requirement for both donors and political parties to have designated accounts and branches. While the identity of the donors is not disclosed, he explained that it is known to the banking system, as there are KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, which include providing Aadhar numbers and addresses.The solicitor general justified the 1% vote threshold for political parties to receive funds through the bonds, stating that it is intended to prevent the formation of fake parties solely for the purpose of claiming exemptions.Mehta highlighted another safety feature built into the scheme, the validity of only 15 days for the bonds. He asserted that the 15-day limit reduced the potential for quid pro quo deals as donors are required to give the bonds within this period. Moreover, to further minimize the risk, if the bonds are not encashed within the stipulated timeframe of 15 days from the date of issue, the amount goes to the PM Relief Fund, and the donor can’t recover it. While opponents object to the confidentiality of donors in the electoral bond scheme, SG Mehta said that maintaining the secrecy of donors was essential and that the bonds were designed with stringent confidentiality measures. Breaching this confidentiality would leave digital footprints and result in criminal liability for those involved. He said that the investigative agencies could access the details only with a court order.He said no transparent political donation scheme will work if there is no confidentiality. If it is publicly disclosed who donated to which party, it will result in retribution and victimisation of the donor from other political parties. And if therefore the confidentiality clause is removed, the donors will opt to donate through cash instead. SG Mehta said that the Electoral Bonds Scheme had been framed in such a manner that it ensured the confidentiality of the donor entirely until the court ordered otherwise. Only the political party that receives the donation will know the identity of the donors, and others will not know it. The court asked to know about the right of voters to know the donors of the parties, Tushar Mehta said it is not realistic to expect voters to make decisions based on campaign contributions from specific individuals or organizations. Instead, voters base their decisions on factors like ideology, principles, leadership, and the efficiency of a political party, he said. The SG added that businesses may support political parties that create a favourable environment for their operations, but this doesn’t necessarily involve a quid pro quo arrangement where financial contributions lead to political favours. He said, “Purity of election is supreme over the right to vote. Voter votes not based on which party is funded by whom, voter votes based on ideology, principle, leadership, efficiency of the party.” Explaining further why the donor identity needs to be kept confidential, SG Mehta said that there are five crucial considerations in the realm of electoral financing. These considerations include the imperative to reduce the reliance on cash in the electoral process, the promotion of authorized banking channels for campaign contributions, the incentive of confidentiality for donors using these channels, the paramount need for transparency in electoral financing, and the prevention of any form of kickbacks or quid pro quo between those in power and financial benefactors. SG Mehta also invoked the right to privacy, which has been upheld by the apex court, to justify why the donors have the right to keep their identity undisclosed. He referred to the KS Puttaswamy judgment, in which the court had recognized the fundamental right to informational privacy. He emphasized the need to balance the right to know and the right to informational privacy, arguing that the right to informational privacy could be asserted against the general right to know. Mehta said that while the public had a right to know, it should be limited to cases of genuine public interest, and curious or prying inquiries should not infringe upon an individual’s privacy. He pointed out that information about which company had purchased how many bonds and which political party had received how many bonds was already in the public domain. Any additional disclosure beyond this might encourage a return to cash-based political funding, which would not be in the legitimate state’s interest.Adding to the arguments, Attorney General for India R Venkatramani said that there should be specific and direct arguments against the scheme and not broad statements which may resemble a political debate.  Stating that the government was moving from an unregulated system to a regulated system, he added that one cannot say that they would look at each statute in isolation and call them into question. The AG further argued that the scheme doesn’t violate any existing right of any person. While the Supreme Court has reserved its verdict, the court suggested that an alternative system could be devised for political donations to remove the “flaws” in the current system. However, the apex court made it clear that it would not suggest going back to the cash-only system, adding that the deficiencies in the existing system should be addressed.“We do not want to go back to a cash-only system. We are saying do it in a proportionate, tailor-made system which overcomes the serious deficiencies of this electoral bond system,” the Court said. The Court also made it clear that only the legislature or the executive can undertake such an exercise and the Court will not step into that arena.The court said, “You can still devise a system which balances out in a proportional way. How it is to be done is for you to decide. We will not step into that arena, that is not part of our function”. Responding to the five crucial considerations mentioned by SG Mehta, the CJI said, “The balance has to be drawn by the legislature and by the executive; not by us. We are quite conscious of that.”Responding to the arguments by petitioners that the scheme has not stopped black money flowing into parties as cash donations are not banned, CJI said that the validity of the scheme was not necessarily linked to its success in reducing black money and that the main objective was to enhance transparency. He said, “On a constitutional level, this argument will not stand. The fact that they have been unable to or they did not dry all cash sources – is not a ground to challenge the validity of the scheme.”Justice Khanna emphasized that the electoral bond system aimed to ensure money came through regular banking channels with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, which was not the case with cash donations. He also pointed out that the scheme aimed to protect the identity of donors for various reasons.In 2018, the BJP-led government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the Electoral Bond Scheme to promote transparency and legitimacy in political party funding in India. The Ministry of Finance developed this scheme, which uses bearer instruments and strict Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, to create a robust and responsible framework for political contributions.Political parties in India can effectively use funds during elections due to accessible and inclusive political contributions. The electoral bonds’ tax treatment promotes financial transparency, and their integrity is ensured by banning trading. Additionally, the scheme redirects unutilized funds to the Prime Minister Relief Fund, demonstrating responsible financial transactions and reducing the influence of black money in politics. This is a significant step towards strengthening India’s democratic foundation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

25,"2 November, 2023 ","Inside Hamas’ terror den: From building a web of tunnels to depriving civilians of fuel, here is how the terror group is running a sophisticated campaign"," Hamas is maintaining a stockpile of more than 200,000 gallons of fuel for the rockets it fires into Israel and generators that provide clean air and electricity to its terror tunnels.Following the deadly 7th October terror attacks by Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in its response have eliminated several Hamas terrorists, struck terrorist targets and infrastructure, and hit approximately 300 targets including anti-tank missiles posts, rocket launch posts, and terrorist compounds inside underground tunnels.Over the last day, during ground operations:🔻Numerous Hamas terrorists have been eliminated.🔻The IAF struck terrorist targets and infrastructure.🔻IDF combat forces struck approximately 300 targets, including:• Anti-tank missiles posts.• Rocket launch posts.•… pic.twitter.com/RymFDCFrw1Israel’s all-out war on the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas is a resolute retaliation to the 7th October attacks. More than 1,400 people, mostly Israelis, lost their lives and at least 220 were taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza after the brutal terrorist attack. The terrorist group had also launched 5,000 rockets on Israel and its terror attempts continue to this day.Hamas continues to hoard resources to feed itself and its offensive on Israel while left-liberals and Islamists further the terrorist group’s narrative across the world by misusing images and videos of civilian casualties in Gaza to demonise Israel. Amidst all this, innocent civilians, who have historically been used as human shields by Hamas, are paying the price of Hamas’ terrors with their lives.On 24th October, Hamas released two of the 220 Israeli hostages. The two women were identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. While narrating her ordeal, Lifshitz said that she was beaten, laid on a motorcycle, and carried through the fields towards Gaza. “They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks,” she said.The surprising part of the revelation was when she mentioned that the terrorists seemed prepared for the situation (hostage situation) as they had everything in the tunnels that men and women needed including shampoo. And yet, the two hostages were provided with only meal a day which barely included a cucumber and some cheese. Lifshitz said that she was also provided with medicines.It is shocking, to say the least, that a Palestinian terrorist group – existing with the sole aim of eradicating Jews from the face of the earth – is living and operating in abundance when the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank barely have toilet water to survive. Demanding the release of its hostages, when Israel shut water, electricity and fuel supply to Gaza, the global Islamist ecosystem used the suffering of civilians to demonise Israel instead of holding Hamas accountable.The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Under the rubble on Gaza’s surface exists a web of terrorist tunnels safeguarding Hamas. Referred to as the “Gaza Metro” by the Israeli Defense Forces, the terror tunnels form the biggest part of Hamas’ infrastructure.“Imagine we are looking at the Gaza Strip and really think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for the civilians and another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,” the IDF spokesperson said.Listen in as an IDF Spokesperson @jconricus provides a situational update on all fronts, as the war against Hamas continues. https://t.co/jSkwACh3iNThese tunnels are used by Hamas to launch rockets in Israel and ensure the safe movement of terrorists across the city. This terror infrastructure right under the civilian infrastructure prompted the Israeli forces to ask civilians to evacuate areas where it was scheduled to conduct strikes.A compilation of videos published by IDF on YouTube shows how the terrorists use the tunnels to smuggle, transport, and store ammunition. According to the IDF, some of these tunnels span under the border of Israel. In fact, Hamas has openly admitted that the tunnels built inside Gaza are for the protection of its terrorists and not for civilians. This proud admission by the terrorist group was in response to a question that why Hamas wasn’t building bomb shelters within Gaza to save the residents from Israeli bombings.Hamas terrorist Mousa Abu Marzouk said that it was the responsibility of the UN and Israel to protect civilians living in Gaza. “We have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed. These tunnels are meant to protect us from aeroplanes. We are fighting from inside the tunnels,” the terrorist said.Amid the ground operations, Israel is now targeting the roughly 300-mile (500 km) tunnel network under Gaza believed to run deeper than 200 feet.The Israeli forces are specifically targeting areas where a cluster of Hamas infrastructure is centred. Under Gaza’s largest hospital Al Shifa, lies the headquarter of Hamas. A video released by the IDF shows a compound that Hamas has built under the Al Shifa hospital which includes storage facilities for weapons, command and control facilities, offices and places for terrorists to hide in.Operational Update with an IDF Spokesperson, @jconricus https://t.co/3rYeT2Nc2e“This puts the people that are being treated in the hospital at risk. It should be condemned, it should be stopped,” Conricus said. The hospital’s neonatal unit sustained damages following the initial strikes by Israel targeting “Jihadi” infrastructure which surrounds the very hospital.The Shifa Hospital is not only the largest hospital in Gaza but it also acts as the main headquarters for Hamas’ terrorist activity. Terrorism does not belong in a hospital and the IDF will operate to uncover any terrorist infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/Ybpln5xQb2Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has taken refuge under the Al-Shifa Hospital and is using the patients at the hospital as a shield to protect himself. The Hamas terrorist had once mercilessly killed a person with a sink while he was in prison on the suspicion of collaborating with Israel.The Washington Post in 2014 reported that Al Shifa Hopital had become the “de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders who can be seen in the hallways and offices”. In 2014, when Israel and Palestine agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt, a protester from a mosque opposite to the Al Shifa hospital blared on a loudspeaker calling the then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his administration “traitors” and “collaborators”.Crowds had gathered at the hospital in July 2014 throwing shoes and eggs at the health minister who was turned away before he reached the hospital. The Al Shifa hospital is just one among the several civilian structures that have regularly been used by Hamas to launch attacks at Israel.According to a report by Tablet dated 2014, one of Hamas’ main command bunkers was located beneath Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The bunker was equipped with sophisticated communications equipment and housed a part of the Hamas leadership.The report claimed that in 2006, PBS aired a documentary showing how gunmen roamed the halls of the Al Shifa Hospital, intimidated the staff, and denied them access to protected locations within the building where the camera crew was prohibited from filming.Mosques and UN facilities in close proximity to civilian infrastructure are also being used by Hamas to launch attacks. “Hamas terrorists operate inside and under civilian buildings, precisely because they know the IDF distinguishes between terrorists and civilians,” RAdm. Daniel Hagari of the IDF said on 29th October.Beneath the hospitals, schools, mosques, and homes in Gaza lies a horrific underworld of Hamas terrorism. In order to dismantle Hamas, we must dismantle their underground tunnels. pic.twitter.com/pHBUPUqzQRA bunch of images shared by the Israel Defense Forces on X, formerly Twitter, on 22nd October, showed that a Hamas rocket launch site is located right opposite the UN building in Gaza, another such terror launchpad is located exactly opposite a mosque.A third image shows a Hamas rocket launchpad dangerously close to neighbouring schools in the area.It is with the help of such launchpads that Hamas is still being able to launch rockets at Israel, 24 days after the deadly 7th October terrorist attacks.In a video shared by the Israel War Room on X, a Hamas terrorist can be seen dressed in civilian clothes and launching a rocket at Israel. “He disguises himself as a civilian, while engaged in military activity, so that later they can claim that Israel is harming civilians,” a tweet by Israel War Room reads.The military wing of Hamas publishes documentation of large mortars being fired at Israel.Pay attention to an interesting detail: the operative of the military wing of Hamas is dressed in civilian clothes. He disguises himself as a civilian, while engaged in military activity,… pic.twitter.com/5qRMePlhlsIn a video recently shared by Hamas, terrorists can be seen dressed in civilian clothes emerging out of a terror tunnel armed with rockets to attack an Israeli tank. Another video published by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a terrorist group committed to the eradication of Israel and Jews, shows terrorists in civilian clothes launching rockets and chanting “Allah Hu Akbar”. “Just because mainstream media reports civilian deaths in Gaza doesn’t mean they are all really civilians,” the Israel War Room tweeted on X.In this video published today by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), rocket-launching terrorists are dressed in civilian clothing.Just because mainstream media reports civilian deaths in Gaza doesn't mean they're all really civilians. pic.twitter.com/wSjFBKsv1WCoinciding with this, there was the recent incident wherein during a live broadcast on CNN, a supposed corpse of a civilian in Gaza was seen moving its head. The viral video on X was shared by Israel War Room with the caption, “Pallywood is racist and based on absolutely NO facts or truth, except for the occasional dead body moving its head while a Palestinian woman wails and screams for the camera.”“Pallywood is racist and based on absolutely NO facts or truth,” except for the occasional dead body moving its head while a Palestinian woman wails and screams for the camera. https://t.co/HMIcU6N0nX pic.twitter.com/xdaEzrbWoMGlobal media is rife with news reports of fuel and electricity shortages in hospitals in Gaza. However, according to IDF, Hamas has stored 500,000 litres of fuel that they refuse to provide to the people of Gaza. In a testimony, a Hamas terrorist captured by Israeli forces can be heard saying that the Hamas fill tanks full of fuel for themselves.The IDF has also alleged that Hamas is also stealing fuel including 50,000 litres from a private vendor in northern Gaza and 24,000 litres of fuel from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).When you hear that people in Gaza don't have fuel, it's because Hamas took all of it. pic.twitter.com/i2MOjesZxwA call between an IDF officer and a senior Gazan Energy official has revealed that Hamas has at least a million litres of fuel, and gas stations are full of fuel. “Underground, I am sure they have at least half a million litres. As you know, they need oxygen in the tunnels, and they need phones, and they need showers and lighting there,” the Gazan Energy official said.Hamas’ terrorist headquarters under the Shifa hospital is draining the necessities—fuel, oxygen, water and electricity—from the Gazans and staff and using them for terrorism. pic.twitter.com/LKCu0WILvdIn a tweet on 24th October, the UNRWA said that if it does not get fuel urgently, it will be forced to halt operations in the Gaza Strip. In response to the same, the IDF shared an image of huge fuel reserves with Hamas and captioned it, “These fuel tanks are inside Gaza. They contain more than 500,000 litres of fuel. Ask Hamas if you can have some.”The IDF has released another recording of a conversation between a Hamas terrorist and a Gazan citizen exposing how Hamas takes fuel from hospitals in the region. In the conversation, a Gazan citizen can be heard pleading for fuel in the course of the talk which reveals how Hamas has been stealing fuel from hospitals.Listen for yourselves: pic.twitter.com/iABBnFe1PQA report by NBC claims that the terrorist group is maintaining a stockpile of more than 200,000 gallons of fuel for the rockets it fires into Israel and generators that provide clean air and electricity to its terror tunnels. Safe to say that Hamas is denying the ample amount of fuel it has in store to the Gaza civilians in order to be able to sponsor its terrorist ativities against Israel.In the 7th October attacks, Hamas was equipped with a barrage of rockets, paragliding equipment, machine guns, convoys, RPGs, and anti-tank missiles to name a few. According to the Alma Research and Education Centre, one of Israel’s weak points exploited by Hamas was the reluctance to deploy ground manoeuvring forces. What the world witnessed in the 7th October attacks was Hamas launching an attack on Israel from all fronts and “precise armament for the manoeuvring move into the invaded territory”.“Such assistance can be in the form of a preliminary fire for the maneuver or through the activation of fire at the same time as the maneuver. Such activation requires a high level of coordination in the intelligence-attack combination due to the high dynamism of the maneuvering move. It seems that Hamas, in the current attack operation, has implemented this new concept,” the report says.Notably, many of Hamas’ operations are inspired by Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group also infamous for its anti-Israel activities. Both Hamas and Hezbollah established dedicated forces (the Radwan force in Hezbollah and the Nukhba force in Hamas) to launch rockets into Israeli territory on a large scale. Like within Gaza, terror tunnels were dug on the border with Lebanon and on the border with the Gaza Strip, which, as established before, are used for infiltration of terrorists into Israeli territory.Founded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982, the Hezbollah have historically backed Hamas in its war against Israel. Shortly after the 7th October attacks by Hamas, Israel’s northern front came under firing and attack from Hezbollah although the situation was relatively contained. The IDF has said that Hezbollah is continuing its attack across the northern border.“They have fired rockets, they have tried to infiltrate, they have fired dozens of anti-tank missiles at our civilians and at our military positions. They have fired rockets at our positions in Mount Dov and at our communities,” IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said. In retaliation, Israel has targeted Hezbollah infrastructure including weapons, posts and sites in Lebanon.Operational Update with an IDF Spokesperson, @jconricus https://t.co/3rYeT2Nc2eMoreover, a research report from 2021 exposed the scope of Hamas’ military activities in Lebanon with the objective to create an additional front against Israel. As per Alma Research and Education Centre, the terrorist group has a “Construction Bureau” based in Lebanon and Turkey, which shapes Hamas’s forces in all areas that it operates in including Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon.This Bureau of Hamas comprises “specialised departments, each responsible for different sets of activities, such as weapons manufacturing, military intelligence, combat training, communications, funding, planning, logistics, security, and foreign relations”. Moreover, Hamas’ two operational units in Lebanon – El Shimali and Khaled Ali develop and produce their own weapons including rockets, offensive drones, and small unmanned underwater vehicles. They also set up operational cells while preparing attack plans against Israel.Between May and August 2021, there were five incidents of Grad rockets from Lebanon against Israel, reports suspect that Hamas was behind the attacks. According to a report by Alma Research and Education Centre, Iran’s terror capital is in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is armed with over 200,000 warheads including 70,000 rockets, 145,000 mortars, and precision-guided missiles, and thousands of terrorists trained to invade into Israel and execute a similar attack like Hamas’ attack on 7th October.The scale of the terrorist attacks earlier this month and the specialised arms, logistics, and communication operations to back such attacks prove that unabated terrorism can legitimise its existence which is direct threat to Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,"1 November, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan, Samantha Power, George Soros, the ‘democracy in danger’ and ‘genocide’ cries: A potential regime change op?"," Power's meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan has created a buzz in India. Why Uzbekistan? Why now, especially when the assembly elections fever is at its peak? We do not have the answers. However, now that the Central Asian country is in the spotlight, let me share about someone else who was in Uzbekistan on official business. Samantha Power, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), was there on October 23-24 to preside over the C5+1 Regional Connectivity Ministerial.Samantha Power has an impressive resume – a war correspondent for several publications including The Economist, an author, a government official and a diplomat. Her notable work, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2003. In that book, Power meticulously chronicled a century’s worth of American inaction in the face of massacres. The book inspired the ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine, emphasising that the United States and other nations bear a moral obligation to safeguard persecuted or threatened populations worldwide.Samantha Power boasts a significant history of association with Barack Obama, dating back to his days as a senator. Her journey alongside him began as a foreign policy fellow in 2005-06 in his senatorial office. She further played a pivotal role as a foreign policy adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign. However, she encountered controversy during this time when she referred to Hillary Clinton as ‘a monster’ during an interview, which she thought was an off-record comment, leading to her resignation from the campaign.In late November 2008, as the Obama administration took shape, Power was in the State Department transition team. She was appointed the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights on the National Security Council, serving from January 2009 to February 2013. She spearheaded the creation of a White House task force called the Atrocities Prevention Board – an interagency body to focus on emerging human rights crises before they escalated to the level of genocide. She was its inaugural chairperson. Power’s long-standing association with Obama underscores her involvement in shaping the US foreign policy of the Obama era. She is considered a key figure in persuading President Obama to militarily intervene in Libya; something that Obama considers as the worst decision of his Presidency. Thanks to her unwavering belief in the United States’ responsibility to prevent or alleviate the suffering of civilians in foreign nations, she earned nicknames such as the Ivy League Joan of Arc and Activist-in-Chief.According to The New Yorker, “When she entered the White House, at the age of thirty-eight, she had already established a reputation as a kind of Joan of Arc for humanitarian intervention.” The same article also mentions that while Obama welcomed her advocacy, she used to get on his nerves and that during a meeting to discuss Syria, Obama snapped, “We’ve all read your book, Samantha.” In February 2013, she left the National Security Council. In June of that year, Obama appointed her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. In a 2014 article, The New Yorker stated that unlike Vice President Joe Biden, and others who had risen through the foreign-policy establishment, Power favoured aligning the United States with citizen-led movements.Power was on TIME’s influential 100 list in 2015 (also in 2004), where she was referred to as the ‘new conscience of the US foreign policy establishment’ by Madeline Albright in a tribute titled Enemy of despots. She has been a big advocate of greater interference in the internal affairs of other nations, even military interventions, to defend humanitarianism. Given her openness to military interventions in Libya, Syria and Yemen, she has been often criticised for wanting to solve ‘problems from hell’ by using ‘solutions from hell’. In December 2014, she told The New Yorker, “As time wears on, I find myself gravitating more and more to the GSD people… (‘get shit done’, a term favoured by Susan Rice). Principles and positions only take you so far.”In January 2021, Joe Biden nominated Power to head the USAID.Power’s husband, Cass Robert Sunstein, is a professor and author and was also a part of the Obama administration. His views on ‘Mission LiFE’ were featured by Niti Aayog as well as included in the collection of views published by the Press Information Bureau.Power’s meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.In a March 2011 article on Samantha Power in The New York Times, Kenneth Roth, the then-Executive Director of Human Rights Watch called her “the foremost voice for human rights within the White House, and she has Obama’s ear.” The views of Roth or HRW on India are well, not so great.A more intriguing aspect of Power’s life is her perceived proximity to Henry Kissinger, known for his strong stance against India, as well as with the much-discussed George Soros. Both Kissinger and Soros were present at an exclusive gathering in SoHo on 31 May 2016, to celebrate the publication of a book by Cass Sunstein. A week later, on 8 June, Power received the 2016 Henry A. Kissinger Prize from the man himself. Interestingly, Power had strongly criticised Kissinger’s bloody, anti-human rights record in two of her books, including the Pulitzer Prize winner.Three years before that, in November 2013, when Soros received the top honour at the International Rescue Committee Benefit, Bill Clinton and Samantha Power both lauded him. Samantha Power on Soros: “My first introduction to George was indirect. I met (the late humanitarian) Fred Cuny and heard him describe how he and his patron George Soros were going to single-handedly break the siege of Sarajevo. Humble guys, I thought, modest in ambition. Little did I know.”Six years after that award night, in November 2019, Power tweeted this in response to Hungary kicking out Soros’ Central European University.In a September 2019 interview featured in The Guardian, Samantha Power’s new memoir, The Education of an Idealist, is described as having a broader aim: a call to action during a time of despair, as Donald Trump lays siege to what is left of the liberal order at home and abroad. She expressed her desire for readers to get a renewed sense of agency after reading her book and feel empowered to address the pressing problems around them. She also shared her plan to campaign for the Democratic cause in swing states.Power was in India from 25-27 July 2022. On the 26th, she met with civil society representatives to discuss freedom of expression, speech, identity, and the importance of protecting the rights of minority groups and underscored the continued commitment of the US to work with civil society organisations to advance human rights and fundamental freedoms. Then, on the 27th, addressing an event at IIT Delhi, Power said: “The headwinds against democratic rule are strong the world over. Within the United States and India, there are forces who seek to sow division, who seek to pit ethnicities and religions against one another, who wish to bend laws, abuse institutions and wield violence against those who stand in their way; we saw this, of course, on January 6 in the United States last year…” “But ultimately, what has positioned India as a future development leader has not been its assets but its values… It has been India’s multi-ethnic, multi-party democracy that has allowed it to withstand the challenges… It has been its support for free expression over decades that has allowed injustices to come to light. It has been its tolerance for diversity and dissent that has allowed reforms to take hold and institutions to progress. India’s trajectory has been so strong because – not in spite of – its democracy.”The Telegraph editorial on the 29th read: “While referencing Nehru and M.K. Gandhi, she (Power) did not mention Mr Modi even once. This was no oversight. Instead, it was a nudge to India to clear the shadow hovering over its commitment to its historical values. But a friend can only hold up a mirror. It is New Delhi that needs to look within.”On the 27th, Samantha Power also granted an interview to the NDTV’s Maha Siddiqui. Towards the interview’s conclusion, Siddiqui cited Power’s journalistic background to inquire about her perspective on the declining state of press freedom in India, even referencing a case involving a ‘fact checker.’ While Power refrained from explicit criticism, she expressed her viewpoint in a rather verbose manner by highlighting that India’s strength is rooted in healthy debate and criticism and emphasising that President Biden staunchly supports the cause of press freedom.Rewind to November 2010. During his visit to India, President Obama visited the first-ever Expo on Democracy and Open Government on the 7th in Mumbai. The event also marked the launch of the United States-India Open Government Dialogue, aimed at promoting government transparency and greater citizen engagement. It was led by the United States Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and the Adviser to the Prime Minister of India, Sam Pitroda.Incidentally, Chopra considers Pitroda, his father’s peer, as his inspiration. In November 2020, Chopra was named a member of one of the Joe Biden Presidential Transition Agency Review Teams to support transition efforts. Apart from Pitroda and Chopra, other Americans present for the event were Tom Vilsack (Agriculture Secretary, then and now), Samantha Power and Rajiv Shah (then Administrator USAID, now President of the Rockefeller group). At the end of the expo, Samantha Power read out a statement that ended with, “…we announced at today’s expo an initial commitment of approximately $1m to support the work of Indian civil society in sharing their best practices abroad, with a matching commitment of in-kind assistance by Sam Pitroda that will harness India’s technical expertise to assist governments in harnessing technology, improving services, and enhancing democratic accountability. This is precisely the kind of “partnership built on shared values” that President Obama has hailed during his visit to India.” Sunita Vishwanath (Hindus for Human Rights) was a panellist in the ‘India on the Brink: Preventing Genocide’ conference, a three-day virtual event organised from 26-28 February 2022 to ‘condemn looming genocide of Indian Muslims’. The participants’ list was big, and the conference was duly covered by The Wire. On a side note, Vishwanath was awarded a ‘Champions of Change’ award in July 2015, by the Obama Administration.There has been a consistent rise in the media article titles that talk about India being on the brink.Not to mention, the Gandhi dynasty scion, who never misses an opportunity to talk about erosion or collapse of Indian democracy when abroad.India ranks 8th among the countries that are at the highest risk for mass killing in a ranking given by the America-based Early Warning Project (EWP). The EWP has consistently assessed India as high risk since 2017–18, including second rank in 2021-22. Imagine the world’s largest democracy is assessed to have a higher chance of mass killings than Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Zimbabwe, … EWP, by the way, uses the V-Dem dataset, and V-dem is funded by Soros. (Damn!)Now, amidst the democracy in danger and genocide cries, consider these:In the lead-up to India’s 2024 general election, the spectre of foreign interference is undeniable. India’s pivotal role in the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy is well-established. However, it becomes complicated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolute stand in safeguarding Indian strategic interests and his refusal to succumb to Western pressure. The United States would rather support a candidate who has expressed implicit or explicit openness to Western intervention. There is a realisation that Modi and the BJP are going to win, but that will not deter external players from attempting to weaken Modi, even if there is no chance of defeating him. Against this backdrop, the timing of Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Uzbekistan coinciding with Samantha Power’s visit raises intriguing questions.

27,"5 November, 2023 ","In poll-bound Chhattisgarh, BJP leader Ratan Dubey killed during campaigning by Maoists in Narayanpur"," Ratan Dubey, who was a member of the Narayanpur Zilla Panchayat, had come to Kaushalnar village to campaign for BJP candidate Kedar Kashyap who is contesting against Congress's Chandan KashyapOn Saturday (4th November), BJP leader Ratan Dubey was brutally murdered by Maoists in the insurgency-hit Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh. The BJP’s district vice-president’s murder comes ahead of the first phase of polling in the state.Chhattisgarh | A BJP leader (Ratan Dubey) was murdered today in the insurgency-hit Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh, said Bastar Range IG Sundarraj P. On being asked about Naxal involvement, the IG said that a team has been dispatched to the location and anything in this…Ratan Dubey, who was a member of the Narayanpur Zilla Panchayat, had come to Kaushalnar village to campaign for BJP candidate Kedar Kashyap who is contesting against Congress’s Chandan Kashyap. Dubey was first shot and then attacked with sharp weapons, including axes and daggers, in the Dhaudai region after addressing a poll rally.According to a Times of India report, after the campaign, a cockfight was held near the dais, and a large crowd gathered around it. The Maoist attackers, disguised as villagers, moved away from the gathering and began approaching the dais. Ratan Dubey, however, soon recognised them, got off the dais and started running. The ruckus diverted everyone’s attention away from the cockfight to see Dubey being pursued by several men wielding firearms, daggers, and axes. The chase continued for a few hundred metres until one of the perpetrators shot Ratan Dubey in the back. As an injured Dubey fell on the ground, the Maoist assailants attacked him with axes and daggers.Notably, Ratan Dubey’s murder came just ten days after the Maoists issued a threat to political candidates and their supporters “not to come seeking votes in Bastar.”In a statement on Saturday, Sundarraj P, Inspector General of police of Bastar range said, “At around 05:30 pm, Dubey had gone to Kaushalnar village, about 5km east from Jhargati police station, for campaigning, when he was attacked and killed with a sharp weapon by unidentified Maoists. After receiving information about the incident, police and security forces were sent to the spot, and the deceased’s body is being brought to the district headquarters at Narayanpur.”Later in the evening, the mortal remains of Ratan Dubey were brought to the District Hospital in Narayanpur.#WATCH | The mortal remains of BJP leader Ratan Dubey who was murdered today in the insurgency-hit Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh was brought to the District Hospital in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur. https://t.co/ibZF2HBsIX pic.twitter.com/DBiVQmMggPMeanwhile, Chhattisgarh BJP in-charge Om Mathur said, “While Ratan Dubey was chairing a meeting with the party workers in an interior village, was attacked by the Naxals.

29,"4 November, 2023 ",“I don’t expect votes from Miya Muslims”: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma says he is focused on development of all," The Assam Chief Minister further said that the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had a ""vote relationship"" with the Miya Muslim community in Assam and that votes have been obtained from them over the years by fostering an ""atmosphere of fear.""On Saturday (3rd November), Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that he does not expect Miya Muslims (East Bengal origin Muslims) to vote for him and the BJP. He added that he only expects the indigenous Assamese Muslims to vote for him. It is worth noting here that Miyas are Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims who settled in Assam coming from present-day Bangladesh.During a media interaction in Guwahati CM Sarma said, “I don’t expect votes from Miya Muslims. I don’t visit medical colleges because Miya Muslims are there in more numbers.”CM Sarma reportedly added that his government is primarily focused on the development and welfare of the indigenous Muslims of Assam. “I never expect votes from Muslims, except the indigenous Muslims from Assam. It is very sad that Miya Muslims are more than our indigenous youth in every medical college. I have stopped going much to these colleges now,” the Assam CM said.The Assam Chief Minister further said that the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had a “vote relationship” with the Miya Muslim community in Assam and that votes have been obtained from them over the years by fostering an “atmosphere of fear.”“Both parties have a relationship with Muslims of migrant origin until they get votes, but they have not taken any steps for their development or in the areas where they live,” Sarma reportedly said, adding that no roads, bridges, schools, or colleges have been built for them.FLASH: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday said he does not expect votes from 'Miya Muslims'. Addressing the media in Guwahati, Himanta Sarma further stated that his primary focus is on the well-being and progress of the indigenous Muslim population in Assam.… pic.twitter.com/pAWqg9aI30“As a first step, we have taken measures to improve the living conditions of the indigenous Assamese Muslims and a survey will be conducted soon on them,” continued.However, despite not expecting electoral support from the Miya Muslims, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma clarified that his government is dedicated to providing various government schemes to benefit all residents, including the Miya Muslim community.He said that Miya Muslims have the best days under the BJP government, as the govt undertakes all development activities for them without expecting to get votes. The CM added that if Congress or AIUDF does something for them, they will count how many votes they got in which booth in the area.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma made the comments replying to a question in a press conference he had held to give updates on several major infrastructure projects in the state, including tunnel under Brahmaputra, Kaziranga National Park elevated road and Guwahati ting road.On the other hand, AIUDF chief Maulana Badruddin Ajmal and Dhubri MP while responding to CM Sarma’s comments said that not having Miya Muslims to work would culminate in a deserted Guwahati. “If Miya Muslims do not work for three days in Guwahati, it will turn into a graveyard,” Ajmal said.Notably, Badruddin Ajmal had recently sparked controversy after saying that Muslims are “number 1” when comes to crimes like robbery, rape, murder, eve teasing and also on top in going to jail. He also said that while others are reaching the moon, Muslims are doing PhD on how to go to jail.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

30,"4 November, 2023 ","Gujarat: AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava absconding after assaulting forest dept staff and threatening with gun for removing encroachment, wife and PA arrested"," AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava summoned forest department staff to his residence for a discussion on encroachment of forest land by farmers, but he physically assaulted them and fired a shot in the air demanding that they should pay the farmers AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava from Dediapada in the Narmada district of Gujarat was booked in a case of assault by the police following a complaint filed by the forest department. It is alleged that the MLA called forest department employees to his residence, where the AAP leader is accused of threatening and physically assaulting the individuals. Subsequently, the police apprehended his wife, PA, and another individual after the FIR was lodged. However, MLA Chaitar Vasava is currently evading authorities, with his phone reportedly switched off.Narmada district police chief Prashant Sumbe has provided additional information on the incident. Per his statement, in a village in Dediapada, certain farmers had unlawfully occupied forest department land and initiated farming activities. Upon the department’s intervention to remove the encroachment, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Chaitar Vasava summoned the forest department staffers to his residence for a discussion, where the entire episode occurred.Providing further elaboration, the officer stated that certain farmers had encroached upon forest department land for farming, prompting the department’s removal of the encroachment on 29th October. Subsequently, Dediapada MLA Chaitar Vasava invited the forest department staff members to his residence to discuss the issue. On the evening of 30th October, the staff members arrived at the MLA’s residence.According to the police officer’s statement, during the incident, the MLA allegedly got into a scuffle with the forest employees, physically assaulting them. The MLA reportedly threatened them and asked to provide money to the farmers and also threatened to kill the employees if they did not comply. Additionally, the police officer revealed that the AAP MLA Chaitar Vasava discharged a round in the air using a firearm during the altercation.On the following day, Chaitar Vasava’s personal assistant (PA) allegedly contacted the forest department employees once more, pressuring them to provide money to the farmers. Subsequently, later that evening, the employees reportedly handed over the money to one of the farmers. However, the forest staff members eventually approached the police with these developments.The police officer further said, “A case was registered on the basis of a complaint from the forest department after the matter came to our notice. A case of rioting, assault on a public servant, and extortion was booked. Additionally, sections of the Arms Act were also included.”Apart from Chaitar Vasava, a case was also registered against his wife, PA and the farmer. MLA’s wife Shakuntala Ben, PA Jitendrabhai and farmer Rameshbhai have been arrested. The MLA has now gone underground and is being searched by the Narmada police. Police have said that they will complete the legal proceedings very soon and conduct further investigation.It is worth mentioning that no kind of cultivation can be done on the land of the Forest Department without the permission of the government. Despite the earlier instructions, some farmers had grown the crop, due to which the forest department was forced to take action.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

31,"4 November, 2023 ",Infighting continues in MP Congress unit: 39 leaders expelled for contesting against party’s official candidates," A few of the prominent names expelled from the Congress party’s primary membership include former MP Premchand Guddu (Alot), former MLA Antar Singh Darbar (Mhow), former MLA Yadvendra Singh (Nagod), state party spokesman Ajay Singh Yadav (Khargapur), Nasir Islam (Bhopal North) and Amir Aqueel (Bhopal North).On 4th November (Saturday), the Madhya Pradesh Congress functionary announced that the state unit has expelled 39 leaders from the party’s primary membership for six years. According to the party functionary, they have been expelled for contesting the upcoming state assembly elections against the party’s official candidates. According to a release issued by the party’s state vice-president Rajiv Singh, these 39 leaders were expelled from the Congress on the directives of the party’ state unit chief Kamal Nath.The release added that these expelled leaders are contesting elections either as independent candidates or on the ticket of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).A few of the prominent names expelled from the Congress party’s primary membership include former MP Premchand Guddu (Alot), former MLA Antar Singh Darbar (Mhow), former MLA Yadvendra Singh (Nagod), state party spokesman Ajay Singh Yadav (Khargapur), Nasir Islam (Bhopal North) and Amir Aqueel (Bhopal North).The development comes at a time when Congress is at loggerheads with one of its major alliance partners in the I.N.D.I. bloc. The discord which has only worsened with each passing day erupted after disputes arose over the seat-sharing formula in the poll-bound state. Initially, Congress and its I.N.D.I. alliance partner Samajwadi Party were reportedly in talks that the latter could be given six seats to contest in the state elections. However, when Congress announced candidates on assembly constituencies of sitting SP MLAs in MP, a war of words erupted with SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav accusing Congress of ‘betrayal’. Targeting the Congress party, Former UP CM Yadav asserted that Congress is demanding a nationwide caste census only for political benefit. He remarked that the fact that Congress is now requesting a caste census is a ‘miracle.’ The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister emphasised that the grand old party has come to the realisation that voters in backward areas do not support them.Apart from verbal exchanges and jibes, SP also fielded its candidates on 31 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh adding woes to its “alliance” partner Congress. Voting in Madhya Pradesh will take place a fortnight later on 17th November for the 230-seat Madhya Pradesh assembly while the result will be announced on 3rd December. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,"1 November, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan, Samantha Power, George Soros, the ‘democracy in danger’ and ‘genocide’ cries: A potential regime change op?"," Power's meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan has created a buzz in India. Why Uzbekistan? Why now, especially when the assembly elections fever is at its peak? We do not have the answers. However, now that the Central Asian country is in the spotlight, let me share about someone else who was in Uzbekistan on official business. Samantha Power, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), was there on October 23-24 to preside over the C5+1 Regional Connectivity Ministerial.Samantha Power has an impressive resume – a war correspondent for several publications including The Economist, an author, a government official and a diplomat. Her notable work, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2003. In that book, Power meticulously chronicled a century’s worth of American inaction in the face of massacres. The book inspired the ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine, emphasising that the United States and other nations bear a moral obligation to safeguard persecuted or threatened populations worldwide.Samantha Power boasts a significant history of association with Barack Obama, dating back to his days as a senator. Her journey alongside him began as a foreign policy fellow in 2005-06 in his senatorial office. She further played a pivotal role as a foreign policy adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign. However, she encountered controversy during this time when she referred to Hillary Clinton as ‘a monster’ during an interview, which she thought was an off-record comment, leading to her resignation from the campaign.In late November 2008, as the Obama administration took shape, Power was in the State Department transition team. She was appointed the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights on the National Security Council, serving from January 2009 to February 2013. She spearheaded the creation of a White House task force called the Atrocities Prevention Board – an interagency body to focus on emerging human rights crises before they escalated to the level of genocide. She was its inaugural chairperson. Power’s long-standing association with Obama underscores her involvement in shaping the US foreign policy of the Obama era. She is considered a key figure in persuading President Obama to militarily intervene in Libya; something that Obama considers as the worst decision of his Presidency. Thanks to her unwavering belief in the United States’ responsibility to prevent or alleviate the suffering of civilians in foreign nations, she earned nicknames such as the Ivy League Joan of Arc and Activist-in-Chief.According to The New Yorker, “When she entered the White House, at the age of thirty-eight, she had already established a reputation as a kind of Joan of Arc for humanitarian intervention.” The same article also mentions that while Obama welcomed her advocacy, she used to get on his nerves and that during a meeting to discuss Syria, Obama snapped, “We’ve all read your book, Samantha.” In February 2013, she left the National Security Council. In June of that year, Obama appointed her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. In a 2014 article, The New Yorker stated that unlike Vice President Joe Biden, and others who had risen through the foreign-policy establishment, Power favoured aligning the United States with citizen-led movements.Power was on TIME’s influential 100 list in 2015 (also in 2004), where she was referred to as the ‘new conscience of the US foreign policy establishment’ by Madeline Albright in a tribute titled Enemy of despots. She has been a big advocate of greater interference in the internal affairs of other nations, even military interventions, to defend humanitarianism. Given her openness to military interventions in Libya, Syria and Yemen, she has been often criticised for wanting to solve ‘problems from hell’ by using ‘solutions from hell’. In December 2014, she told The New Yorker, “As time wears on, I find myself gravitating more and more to the GSD people… (‘get shit done’, a term favoured by Susan Rice). Principles and positions only take you so far.”In January 2021, Joe Biden nominated Power to head the USAID.Power’s husband, Cass Robert Sunstein, is a professor and author and was also a part of the Obama administration. His views on ‘Mission LiFE’ were featured by Niti Aayog as well as included in the collection of views published by the Press Information Bureau.Power’s meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.In a March 2011 article on Samantha Power in The New York Times, Kenneth Roth, the then-Executive Director of Human Rights Watch called her “the foremost voice for human rights within the White House, and she has Obama’s ear.” The views of Roth or HRW on India are well, not so great.A more intriguing aspect of Power’s life is her perceived proximity to Henry Kissinger, known for his strong stance against India, as well as with the much-discussed George Soros. Both Kissinger and Soros were present at an exclusive gathering in SoHo on 31 May 2016, to celebrate the publication of a book by Cass Sunstein. A week later, on 8 June, Power received the 2016 Henry A. Kissinger Prize from the man himself. Interestingly, Power had strongly criticised Kissinger’s bloody, anti-human rights record in two of her books, including the Pulitzer Prize winner.Three years before that, in November 2013, when Soros received the top honour at the International Rescue Committee Benefit, Bill Clinton and Samantha Power both lauded him. Samantha Power on Soros: “My first introduction to George was indirect. I met (the late humanitarian) Fred Cuny and heard him describe how he and his patron George Soros were going to single-handedly break the siege of Sarajevo. Humble guys, I thought, modest in ambition. Little did I know.”Six years after that award night, in November 2019, Power tweeted this in response to Hungary kicking out Soros’ Central European University.In a September 2019 interview featured in The Guardian, Samantha Power’s new memoir, The Education of an Idealist, is described as having a broader aim: a call to action during a time of despair, as Donald Trump lays siege to what is left of the liberal order at home and abroad. She expressed her desire for readers to get a renewed sense of agency after reading her book and feel empowered to address the pressing problems around them. She also shared her plan to campaign for the Democratic cause in swing states.Power was in India from 25-27 July 2022. On the 26th, she met with civil society representatives to discuss freedom of expression, speech, identity, and the importance of protecting the rights of minority groups and underscored the continued commitment of the US to work with civil society organisations to advance human rights and fundamental freedoms. Then, on the 27th, addressing an event at IIT Delhi, Power said: “The headwinds against democratic rule are strong the world over. Within the United States and India, there are forces who seek to sow division, who seek to pit ethnicities and religions against one another, who wish to bend laws, abuse institutions and wield violence against those who stand in their way; we saw this, of course, on January 6 in the United States last year…” “But ultimately, what has positioned India as a future development leader has not been its assets but its values… It has been India’s multi-ethnic, multi-party democracy that has allowed it to withstand the challenges… It has been its support for free expression over decades that has allowed injustices to come to light. It has been its tolerance for diversity and dissent that has allowed reforms to take hold and institutions to progress. India’s trajectory has been so strong because – not in spite of – its democracy.”The Telegraph editorial on the 29th read: “While referencing Nehru and M.K. Gandhi, she (Power) did not mention Mr Modi even once. This was no oversight. Instead, it was a nudge to India to clear the shadow hovering over its commitment to its historical values. But a friend can only hold up a mirror. It is New Delhi that needs to look within.”On the 27th, Samantha Power also granted an interview to the NDTV’s Maha Siddiqui. Towards the interview’s conclusion, Siddiqui cited Power’s journalistic background to inquire about her perspective on the declining state of press freedom in India, even referencing a case involving a ‘fact checker.’ While Power refrained from explicit criticism, she expressed her viewpoint in a rather verbose manner by highlighting that India’s strength is rooted in healthy debate and criticism and emphasising that President Biden staunchly supports the cause of press freedom.Rewind to November 2010. During his visit to India, President Obama visited the first-ever Expo on Democracy and Open Government on the 7th in Mumbai. The event also marked the launch of the United States-India Open Government Dialogue, aimed at promoting government transparency and greater citizen engagement. It was led by the United States Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and the Adviser to the Prime Minister of India, Sam Pitroda.Incidentally, Chopra considers Pitroda, his father’s peer, as his inspiration. In November 2020, Chopra was named a member of one of the Joe Biden Presidential Transition Agency Review Teams to support transition efforts. Apart from Pitroda and Chopra, other Americans present for the event were Tom Vilsack (Agriculture Secretary, then and now), Samantha Power and Rajiv Shah (then Administrator USAID, now President of the Rockefeller group). At the end of the expo, Samantha Power read out a statement that ended with, “…we announced at today’s expo an initial commitment of approximately $1m to support the work of Indian civil society in sharing their best practices abroad, with a matching commitment of in-kind assistance by Sam Pitroda that will harness India’s technical expertise to assist governments in harnessing technology, improving services, and enhancing democratic accountability. This is precisely the kind of “partnership built on shared values” that President Obama has hailed during his visit to India.” Sunita Vishwanath (Hindus for Human Rights) was a panellist in the ‘India on the Brink: Preventing Genocide’ conference, a three-day virtual event organised from 26-28 February 2022 to ‘condemn looming genocide of Indian Muslims’. The participants’ list was big, and the conference was duly covered by The Wire. On a side note, Vishwanath was awarded a ‘Champions of Change’ award in July 2015, by the Obama Administration.There has been a consistent rise in the media article titles that talk about India being on the brink.Not to mention, the Gandhi dynasty scion, who never misses an opportunity to talk about erosion or collapse of Indian democracy when abroad.India ranks 8th among the countries that are at the highest risk for mass killing in a ranking given by the America-based Early Warning Project (EWP). The EWP has consistently assessed India as high risk since 2017–18, including second rank in 2021-22. Imagine the world’s largest democracy is assessed to have a higher chance of mass killings than Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Zimbabwe, … EWP, by the way, uses the V-Dem dataset, and V-dem is funded by Soros. (Damn!)Now, amidst the democracy in danger and genocide cries, consider these:In the lead-up to India’s 2024 general election, the spectre of foreign interference is undeniable. India’s pivotal role in the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy is well-established. However, it becomes complicated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolute stand in safeguarding Indian strategic interests and his refusal to succumb to Western pressure. The United States would rather support a candidate who has expressed implicit or explicit openness to Western intervention. There is a realisation that Modi and the BJP are going to win, but that will not deter external players from attempting to weaken Modi, even if there is no chance of defeating him. Against this backdrop, the timing of Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Uzbekistan coinciding with Samantha Power’s visit raises intriguing questions.

33,"1 November, 2023 ","The Hindu’s English Magazine ‘FrontLine’ and its Editor decide to officially be Hamas-collaborators: The shameful justification of rape, torture and beheading"," This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War. The Hindu’s fortnightly magazine ‘Frontline’ has now officially taken a stand justifying and whitewashing the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israel’s civilian population on the 7th of October 2023. In an ‘editors note’ published on the 30th of October, FrontLine essentially responded to why it refuses to condemn Islamic terror outfit Hamas. This ‘Frontline’ perhaps felt the need to justify its support to terror after the Israeli Ambassador to India had written a scathing open letter to The Hindu for interviewing Mousa Abu Marzouk – a Hamas official. The Editor of Frontline, Vaishna Roy, took to X to share the despicable note that she penned in the magazine. Editor’s Note: ""When one hears Israeli leaders use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies and accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play."" @frontline_india https://t.co/tj5XXdgX1XThe note by Roy essentially starts by insinuating that the Jews, who were the victims of the Holocaust, have now morphed into the perpetrators of the same atrocities against other people – Palestinians. Roy writes, “When one hears Israeli leaders repeatedly use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies, repeatedly accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, repeatedly claim that their powerhouse of a nation is the victim, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play. The Zionists have taken their generational rage and turned it not against the powerful West, whose arms and support they need, but against the hapless people on whose lands they have settled”.At the very outset, Roy sets the base to justify the terrorism that claimed the lives of women, children and the elderly on the 7th of October 2023 when Hamas, for over 8 hours, went on a rampage of unbridled violence against the Israeli civilian population. Not only does she equate the victims – the Jews – to the perpetrators of their genocide – the Nazis, but also insinuates that anti-semitism is a figment of their imagination – a sentiment of absolute hate the world has seen play out during various “protest marches” by Muslims, chanting for the annihilation of Jews. The crafty insinuation which was far more telling was her snicker at the fact that a “powerhouse of a nation” can ever claim to be the victim. Essentially what Roy was saying is that because Israel is financially and militarily far superior to several nations across the world, it can never claim itself to be the victim of terrorism. Perhaps it would help Roy to understand how terrorism works. Powerful nations with economic and military might win wars owing to that power, however, wars like the one Israel is fighting are generally ‘after the fact’. Terrorist groups and terror nations don’t particularly stick to rules of engagement, international conventions and military ethics. They are human bombs whose sole aim is to inflict damage, for the sake of their vengeful God. What makes them far more dangerous is that death in the process of fighting these “powerful nations”, which are viewed to be the enemies of their fanatic religious campaign, is in itself a reward by their God. When a “powerful nation” is faced with religious mercenaries for whom death itself is a religious reward by God himself, and the worst atrocities against innocent people a not only a tool to achieve that reward but also ordained by their scripture, the “powerful nation” and their people are the victims – notwithstanding their economic or military might. Essentially, the asymmetrical battle is between an all-powerful nation and an all-powerful, vengeful God – a claim by Roy’s mythical ‘victims’ themselves. The ‘all-powerful nation’ is bound by the rules of a civilised nation. Those who fight for an ‘all-powerful God’ adhere to no rules of the civilised world. They adhere to the rules set by their all-powerful God – a God which allows them, nay, ordains them, to murder those who don’t believe in him in the most brutal way known to man. A modern powerful nation is no match to those who believe in a medieval religious war. They never were. They never will be. Europe, which prided itself on being the birthplace of modernity and at one point ruled the entire world is learning this lesson bit by bit – the lessons are brutal, bloody and excruciating – a pain that, according to the ‘faithfuls’, they are destined to endure. Vaishna Roy wants Israelis to die with a smile on their face because they are rich, being murdered by those perceived to be poor – that is not how the world works – except in a communist’s deranged head. Roy in her note counts the dead bodies and compares those lost by Israel and Palestine. She writes, “Yom Kippur, 1973, saw 2,700 Israeli deaths and 19,000 Arab/Palestinian deaths. In the First Lebanon War, the numbers were 1,200 and 20,000. First Intifada: 179 and 1,200; Second Intifada: 900 and 3,300. The four Gaza Wars: 144 Israeli deaths and 4,800 Palestinian deaths. As this goes to press, the corresponding numbers for the ongoing war are 1,400 and 7,300, respectively. Hamas has stones, homemade rockets, tractors, and motorcycles. Israel has the world’s most sophisticated weapons. Israel is a nuclear nation while the Palestinians barely have a nation. Wasn’t it Voltaire who said killing is a crime unless you “kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets”?”What Roy writes here summarily exposes how she has, summarily, decided to be an ally of Islamic Jihad. The Yom Kippur War, for example, was a surprise attack by the Arab-Egypt coalition. It is also known as the Ramadan war because the ‘faithfuls’ believe it is their religious duty to fight and kill the infidels and that holy war, becomes a bit sweeter if the death and destruction are caused on the non-believer’s religious observance day. That Israel was simply better at mounting an offensive, causing more casualties to those who started the war, does not take away from the fact that they were the ones who were attacked. What is far more telling is that Roy even counts the deaths during the Intifadas. The Intifadas were, again, religious wars where the riots and violence were initiated by the Jihadis and sustained by them as well. During the first four years of the Intifada, more than 3,600 Molotov cocktail attacks, 100 hand grenade attacks and 600 assaults with guns or explosives were reported by the Israel Defense Forces. The violence was directed at soldiers and civilians alike. During this period, 16 Israeli civilians and 11 soldiers were killed by Palestinians in the territories; more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 Israeli soldiers were injured. Approximately 1,100 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops.There was instigation from the mosques of Palestine to kill Jews, justification for the genocide of their people and everything that we see the world over when the innocent faithfuls decide to rise against the infidels. After the unbridled violence by Jihadis, Israel defended itself. That defence in itself becomes a reason for Roy to dismiss assertions of the Jews being the victims of Jihad. Vaishna Roy’s shameless apologia for Jihad becomes painfully obvious as she concludes her note. She writes the following: “We are being harangued to condemn Hamas, but Hamas was not begotten in a vacuum. It was born from the bloody union of broken promises and daily humiliations, settler violence and soldier atrocities. Hamas was midwifed when basic humanitarian values were aborted. When UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said exactly this, pointing to the “56 years of suffocating occupation” the Palestinian people have suffered, Israel called for his resignation”, she says. Before we dissect what she has written, let us recap how this war started – what happened on the 7th of October 2023. On the 7th, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. There are painful eyewitness accounts of women being raped, dismembered, burnt alive and tortured, There are testimonies of babies, and toddlers being burnt alive, dismembered, shot and killed. There are testimonies and documented evidence of the brutality that Hamas inflicted. Beheadings. Rapes. Murders. Tortures. Kidnappings and worse – amidst chants of Allahu Akbar. After the terror attack by Hamas, Israel decided to defend itself and unleashed its military might to ensure Hamas – a terrorist organisation – is wiped out. Israel was defending its citizens and also attempting to recover the hundreds of hostages that Hamas had taken. What is pertinent to remember here that Hamas knew this was a war they would not win. They knew that their treacherous attack would lead to Israel using its military might to ensure the hostages were freed and also, that Hamas was wiped off the face of the earth. They still chose to attack Israeli citizens because that is the zealotry that Holy Wars inspire among the followers of the all-powerful God. Vaishna Roy essentially says that the Jews are Nazis because they chose to retaliate after women, children, babies and the elderly were tortured by Islamic terrorists. In the same breath, she also says that her magazine will simply not condemn Hamas because their action is a result of oppression. The reduction of that is simple – Hamas has a right to rape, torture, and behead civilians because they have supposedly been oppressed. They should not be condemned, rather, their barbarity must be understood in context. The language of the victims, so to speak. However, when those being raped, tortured and beheaded decide to say “thus far and no further”, they automatically become Nazis deserving annihilation because any form of retaliation against the Jihadis is “collective punishment” which further victimises the very Jihadis who raped, tortured and beheaded to avenge the oppression that the rapists and murderers experienced, leading them to rape, behead and torture innocent civilians. Further, it is evident that Roy is not particlarly concerned about the lives of Palestinians. If she were, she would, ideally be, a voice against Hamas. Hamas is no friend of the Palestinians. They use Palestinians as human shields, especially children, make hundreds of kilometers of tunnels were civilians are not allowed to take shelter, use aid money to buy weapons and deprive the Palestinians of a normal life. Even if we choose to ignore that Palestinians themselves overwhelmingly support Hamas, if Roy was so concerned, she should be picking her pen up to fight against Hamas, not be their ally. This may seem like intellectual masturbation at best and harakiri at worst, however, it is far more sinister than one imagines – sinister beyond just the context of Israel and Palestine. The overarching and blanket classification of all Muslims as the perennially oppressed endorses their delusion that owing to this mythical oppression, they are allowed to carry out their blood lust for those who refuse to believe in their all-powerful God. Every atrocity, every act of violence, every beheading, every rape, every riot, every stone thrown, every molotov cocktail hurled, every woman stripped, every baby killed, every innocent tortured, every person dismembered is the “language of the oppressed” and therefore, is not only pardonable but even understandable, or worse, acceptable. This delusion of Hamas collaborators like Vaishna Roy puts every Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian, Parsi, Sikh etc at the risk of an impending genocide. This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War.

34,"28 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas war: How propaganda pieces in media are used to generate sympathy for Hamas while demonising Israel," As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quartersOn 7th of October, 2023, hundreds ot arms-wielding men, landed in Israel, as the people were celebrating Yom Kippur, the Jewish festival of repentance, confessions and forgiveness. The men belonged to Hamas (Harkat-ul-Muqawama al-Islamiya or Islamic Resistance Group), a group designated by many countries as a terror organisation and has officially claimed involvement in several terror acts in the region.The audacious attack left more than 1400 unsuspecting Israeli citizens dead, many wounded and over 200 were carried back to the Hamas-controlled areas of Gaza as hostages. Among the dead, were music lovers who were attending a concert for Peace, infants and kids, as per Israel Government, brutally beheaded and burned down.The world watched in horror as reports of common civilians, those who march around crying Islamophobia across the world, like the famous Latifa AbouChakra of UK (She has been hailed in the past as the face of Muslims persecuted by Europeans in Europe where she lives as a refugee, in the name of Islamophobia), were caught cheering up these inhuman killings fancifully calling these unprecedented and brutal killing Resistance or Intifada hailing it as a moment of triumph.Considering the population of Israel, the US called these killings on proportionate basis, a 9-11, many times over. The details are gory and too many, covered too widely across several media reports.What my objective here is not to repeat the gruesome details and broad silence of Muslims as far as condemning the heinous terror act is concerned. As the days pass on, we find the memories of the dead fades, the sudden shock at the sheer audaciousness of the attack and the disbelief at the celebration of death in certain quarters, not among the uneducated and deprived, rather among the intellectuals and the privileged die down.With this those who stayed mum in the face of very human and instinctive outrage at the 7th of October killings in Israel, tried to find voice with a Hospital attack but it turned out to be a failed rocket attack by Hamas terrorist which caused the misguided missile land in the parking lot of the ill-fated hospital. This clever game of creating fake narrative has been going on for decades and may be centuries but this time, with the prevalence on unorganised media in democratised digital world, the lies were getting caught as quickly as they were floated.Noted journalist Tavleen Singh, a known Modi-critic, wrote attacking Hamas, and was hounded by islamists for that. The hospital attack, which the Hamas-sympathisers tried to use to counter the inhuman killings of 7th October, turned out to be their own doing and took the wind out of the neatly floated Palestine propaganda balloon.However, after initial dilli-dally, Indian National Congress came out with vague statement and then again went into silence. One would have thought that they have run out of their interest in a foreign event, given that elections are around in India. But then as if on cue, Priyanka Vadra tweeted, lamenting on deaths in Gaza, totally ignoring the first event which triggered this revenge violence of a recognised state against a recognised terror organisation.Then I read a piece in today’s (28th October, 2023, Indian Express) by Farah Naqvi, who is mentioned as independent writer and activist, much like Latifa Abouchakra of Britain. In her piece titled Amid Crisis, fear-mongering, she tries to rebut another piece by Yeshaya Rosenman,  a Jewish journalist. Farah Naqvi was incidentally also a member of National Advisory Council of Sonia Gandhi during Congress-led UPA Government, which was an unconstitutional body operating over the elected parliament of India with Sonia Gandhi as quasi-head of the Government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.Farah Naqvi, is the daughter of a noted journalist, Saeed Naqvi. In the account of her father’s brush with Covid where he survived, getting oxygen, hospital bed and medical attention with struggle (many did not get and lost their lives too), she finds a place to mention Democracy index and other political points, about how things are wrong with India which eventually saved her father, in spite of pandemic which left a global devastation of hitherto unseen proportions. But then that is how intellectuals in India play. Politics come easy to them and gratitude comes with difficulty.Coming back to the current piece, she writes starting from taking the count of dead Palestinians. On the day when Palestinian death toll crossed 7000. This is based on the report given out by the Health Ministry of Hamas controlled Gaza. These casualty figures mentioned in the Indian Express article by Ms. Naqvi have been disputed by the US authorities. That notwithstanding, the dead in Ms Naqvi articles mention only Palestinians, totally ignoring 1400 dead Israelis. She mocks how in the words of the Jewish journalist, who has actually more stake in the conflict perpetrated by Hamas, War Crimes are moral actions, resistance is aggression and occupied and occupier are same-to-same. This is where it gets clever. She has in one sentence called the response of a sovereign state to the killing of her citizens by a terror-group- war crime, mass-manslaughter by the terror group as Resistance, and called the Jewish who were rehabilitated in their ancient lands by a UN mandate, after the sufferings and genocide in Hitler’s holocaust, as occupier. Now this is a brilliant propaganda piece for master-class in journalism.In his much acclaimed book, On Writing, Sol Stein gives a very interesting example with two news pieces. I quote them here. The first one read- Terence McNiece, 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.The same piece of news, when written by a smart journalist like Ms Naqvi would read as, again quoting Sol Stein, According to the testimony of her mother, Terrance McNiece wanted a bicycle more than anything in the world, but she couldn’t afford to buy one. Terence, age 14, was arraigned yesterday in Town Court for allegedly stealing a bicycle belonging to a neighbour.Sol writes- Conflict can arise from a thwarted desire, but the desire must be planted here.Does this not explain the occupier-occupied narrative that Ms Naqvi, like all closet Islamist supremacists, are peddling? What can be a bigger, loftier and nobler desire than to be free, the desire to not be occupied. Only slight overlooking of the fact is needed, like Jews lived there centuries before the advent of Islam, that the First Temple was made around ten Centuries before Christ, and almost 15 centuries before the advent of Islam.She has a problem with the Jewish writer trying to superimpose the developments in the Middle-East on India, in terms of Hindus and Muslims of India. But is that not the reason that she has written this rebuttal, she, who technically has no skin in the game, against the person who has something personal at stake here. She has written it as a Muslim and not as an Indian. And I will tell you why- because her history of Al-Aqsa Mosque does not start with Jewish King Soloman but with the fairy tale of Islam, just as her history of Kashi Vishwanath does not start with Kashi being the oldest Hindu city, but it starts with Aurangzeb when after destruction of a very Arabic-Sounding Gyaan Vapi, Muslims went to Courts claiming it is their unalienable right to wash their hands and feet over the structure which Hindus consider their religious idol.The very article which she wrote to pooh-pooh the irrational fears of Yeshahaya, as far as Hindus in India are concerned, substantiates that fear, by the way she reports the terror attack, exposes that hatred that she has. It also underscores the point the Jewish journalist has made, she wants you to be unsuspecting, lulled into a false sense of security, the way Kashmiri Hindus were in the 90s, the Lahori Hindus were in 1946, the way Bengalis of Dhaka were in 1946, till such time that these fears come real.When quoting how the article ends with – If Congress leaders can not find within them a spine, they should remember that they still have a neck.- made her cringe, one wonder if Sar Tan Se Juda slogans coming out on the streets of Bharat made her cringe as much as to write a piece on it, like ever?Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

35,"24 October, 2023 ","Bhagwa Love Trap – a figment of Islamist imagination, created merely to harass Hindu men and counter real cases of Love Jihad, claiming lives of Hindu women"," Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one's identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis. Love jihad is said to be a figment of the imagination of India’s ‘extreme Hindu religious organisations’. According to Indian media and a large intellectual elite, it is also regarded to be an Islamophobic conspiracy theory concocted by Hindutva ideology followers. They often dismiss it as a political ploy to polarise Hindu voters in support of the now-ruling BJP. Even a sizable portion of Hindus do not believe in the existence of Love Jihad. Despite all the outrage from both parts of society, both are often at odds when it comes to Hindu women eloping with Muslim men in huge numbers.The truth is that many Hindu cinema actors are married to Muslim men in the Indian film business. There is no controversy when renowned actors like Amir Khan, Shahrukh, Saif Ali Khan, and Kabir Khan marry Hindu women. Nawab Pataudi, Azharuddin, and Zahir Khan are all married to well-known Bollywood actresses. Indira Gandhi married Feroz Khan, and BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain have Hindu spouses, yet no one has ever questioned it, and no one has ever termed it Love Jihad. Why? Consider following few examples: Case 1. In August 2014, national shooting champion Tara Shahdeo from Ranchi lodged an FIR citing her husband Ranjit Kumar Kohli alias Rakibul Hasan Khan in the national news headlines. Rakibul pretended to be Hindu and introduced his family as a Hindu household. Tara was exposed to his lies when Rakibul asked her to convert to Islam immediately after a marriage sermonised with Hindu tradition in a five-star hotel at Ranchi. Case 2. Sakshi, 16, was slaughtered by her purported lover on May 29 after she refused to continue their connection. Sakshi discovered that the 20-year-old man’s name was Mohammad Sahil, not Sunny. Sahil stabbed the woman numerous times before crushing her skull with a cement boulder in a gruesome murder. Images of Sahil wearing a Kalawa and Rudraksha mala had also emerged.Case 3.  In February 2023, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand’s holy city, Azhar Ahmed pretended to be Rahul in order to marry a Hindu lady, and after nine years of marriage, the victim discovered she was living with a Muslim man. The truth was revealed when she unintentionally discovered an Aadhaar Card at home. It included a picture of her spouse (Rahul), but the name given was Azhar Ahmad. Case 4.  This was December 2022 from Bihar’s Siwan area in which a Muslim guy pretended to be a Punjabi Hindu in order to snare a lady and then abandoned her to seduce another Hindu woman. The accused’s name was Kaleemulla, and he pretended to be Sameer Khanna. He converted the victim, Ratna, to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha Khatun. At the Hussain Ganj police station, a First Information Report (number 324/2022) was filed.Case 5. In July 2022, a case in which a lady, Rachna Solanki, made a police complaint against her husband, Amit Kumar Singh, who was actually Iqrar Qureshi. She discovered the truth nine years after their marriage. Iqrar had two Adhar Cards and his name was put as Amit Kumar on the wedding invitation. On June 18, 2022, the first information report (number 354/2022) was filed at the Jagdishpura police station in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh. The pair performed Diwali puja and visited many temples together. Rachna claims to be a devout disciple of Lord Hanuman.Case 6. In June 2022, this case is from Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal area. Here, a woman doctor alleged that the accused, Nehal Khan, disguised as a Hindu in order to ensnare and sexually abuse her and that Nehal lived with her as if she were a Hindu. He accompanied her to temples and observed all rites and holidays. It was impossible for me to believe he was Muslim. Nehal began pressuring Priya to convert to Islam.Let us discuss the common feature in all of these cases: concealing one’s true identity in order to get close to a woman (or very often, a minor). Rakibul hides his identity as being Muslim to marry Tara. To entice the Hindu girl, Iqrar Qureshi disguised himself as Amit Kumar. Sahil Ahmad impersonates Sunny in order to lure Sakshi, marry her, and then murder her when she refuses to convert to Islam. Kallimulla disguised himself as Sameer Khanna to marry Ratna, but when he changed her name to Ayesha Khatun, only she realised it was a ruse. Every day, hundreds of incidents emerge from all around the nation in which Hindu, Christian, Jain, and Sikh females are being deliberately targeted to convert to Islam by this technic. In certain cases, Muslim men who have been captured with Hindu girls by Bajrang Dal activists have admitted to receiving training and money from particular Mosques or Madrassa for suspected Love Jihad, and the incentives are remitted while keeping the girl’s social and financial level in mind.This disguise as Hindu and concealment of Muslim identity in order to entice Hindu girls and women to marry and convert to Islam is known as “Love Jihad” and it is for real. Every day a section of the media is reporting such news of such cases of “Love Jihad.” Concealment of identity is not the only parameter, however. There are several other cases of forced conversion and violence too that have emerged, that fall under the ambit of Love Jihad. The accusation of love Jihad is not about two adults getting along after a courtship, working together, studying together, or even marrying each other where religious considerations are out in the open and anyone who insinuates otherwise is clearly trying to whitewash the criminal phenomenon. Love jihad is often referred to as a hate campaign by Indian intellectual militia. Efforts are being made to establish that it has connections with previous hate campaigns, present white nationalist conspiracy theories, Euro-American Islamophobia etc. It is, however, a well-known fact that Islamists are running this love jihad franchise as their flagship programme as organised and coordinated Jihad against Kafir women – the aims are simple – subjugation and conversion. Let us now discuss the purported “Bhagwa Love Trap” conspiracy theory by Muslim organisations in India. Since the Love Jihad module is in the public domain with the efforts of Hindu organisations such as RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal etc., Muslim groups have started countering it with a fake narrative. Recently, Muslim scholar Shoeb Jamai accused Hindu organisations of creating Hindu boy’s clubs to seek Muslim females for marriage and conversion. They claimed to have seen a lot of Muslim women hanging out with Hindu men. They showed footage showing Burqa-clad ladies riding pillion on motorbikes with Hindu youths and attacking them, dubbed the “Bhagva Love Trap. According to a covert operation published by Opindia.com, several Islamists, who are part of the “Behen Beti Bachao” group made on social media which the Opindia reporter could sneak into, regularly share Pakistani propaganda content surrounding the “Bhagva Love Trap theory”. These include but are not limited to the inciteful and Hinduphobic videos created by a Pakistani YouTuber Ibne Kazi (screenshots of the WhatsApp chats are attached in the detailed article). The Islamist shared a leaflet, falsely claiming that 10 lakh Muslim women are being converted to Hinduism each year by the RSS as also claimed by Islamic cleric Nomani in his detailed speech. The propaganda-laden material also alleged the conversion and marriage of 800 Muslim women to Hindu men in Amaravati, Maharashtra. Based on reports and social media videos, OpIndia has compiled a total of 50 cases and posted the link on its website, where Hindu men and Muslim women were attacked by extremists under the pretext of the ‘Bhagva love trap.’ The attacks were carried out citing that a sinister plot was underway to convert Muslim women to Hinduism by luring them into a love trap – a conspiracy theory espoused by Sajjad Nomani in his multiple videos.Where a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl couple are concerned, this is not a matter of masking one’s identity; Hindu guys are known by their genuine names to Muslim women, unlike their Muslim counterparts in the cases of “Love jihad”. Therefore, it is evident that BLT was only created as a figment of the Islamist imagination to counter the very real cases of Love Jihad which are claiming the lives of several Hindu women on a regular basis.

36,"23 October, 2023 ",The Hindu continues to peddle the North-South divide based on lies peddled by Communist Party leader and JNU prof: 15th Finance Commission report and the truth," The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India as a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Just about 15 days back, The Hindu published an article on an imaginary North-South divide and we had given a detailed rebuttal to it. In the conclusion of that article, we had written that “It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too.”Looks like someone at The Hindu took this conclusion seriously and wanted to test if we would really repeatedly counter their repeated lies! And so, on the exact same topic, they publish yet another tripe on October 20th.  This time, they interview two known suspects – one is a former Finance minister from the Communist party (Thomas Issac) and another is a former professor from JNU (Balveer Arora). Thomas Issafc, who sadly was a Finance Minister once, opens his argument with an outright lie – that there are only two criteria defined by the Finance Commission on how to devolve funds to the States. We have repeatedly busted this lie but there just seems to be no end to the freedom that The Hindu and their ilk provide to these serial liars. The 15th Finance Commission has the following 6 criteria on which it decides how best to devolve the funds to the states in India. Income Distance and Population from the 2011 census are just 2 of those criteria. States that have done well on Forest and Ecology, Demographic performance and Tax Effort actually get rewarded better by the 15th Finance Commission – which is basically the key demand of these folks! It is intriguing to see this ilk assume that the people of this country will not have access to such basic information, and therefore they can simply publish lies and get away with it. The opening argument of the other interviewee, Balveer Aurora, is even more hilarious. In his infinite wisdom, he says – “if the population basis is being shifted from 1971 to a new figure, the weightage of the population can be adjusted. It is not written in stone that it has to remain the same”. Guess what – the weightage to the population in the 13th FC report was 25%. That report used the 1971 census as a reference (Yes, even for the period 2010 to 2015, we used the 1971 census as a reference!). The weightage to the population in the 15th FC report was 15%. That report used the 2011 census as a reference (Finally, the much-needed correction was made). So, when the population basis was shifted from 1971 to 2011, the weightage given only to the population had already been adjusted from 25% to 15%. How does the former Professor from a reputed university like JNU miss such basic information before making such banal arguments? After years of providing a platform for such hate mongers, The Hindu decides for the first time that they will ask a factual question on this subject – and hence pose the question to Thomas Issac:Thomas Issac goes on a verbal tirade that doesn’t answer the question. He continues to claim that “Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu” are at a loss. This argument that states are at a “loss” has been made by politicians from other states too. KCR’s son, KTR, for example, claims that while Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the central government, it only got back 1.68 lakh crores in return. He went to the extent of calling everyone who countered this fallacious argument “ignoramuses”. This set me thinking. In this particular example, the INR 3.68 lakh crores is the amount that people of India, specifically residing in Telangana, have paid as Tax directly to the Government of India. From this amount, a total of 1.78 lakh crore rupees have been transferred to the Government of Telangana, by the Government of India. KTR makes it sound like 3.68 lakh crores is the tax paid by the government of Telangana to the government of India. Thomas Issac also sounds similar in his arguments.Let’s for a moment just buy this argument. If Telangana paid 3.68 lakh crores to the Government of India, how come only 1.78 lakh crores have come back to the government? Because this amount does not include the 1.08 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on roads in Telangana alone. It does not include the 1.58 lakh crore spent directly by GoI on procuring Paddy and Cotton from Telangana alone. It does not include the nearly 1 lakh crore spent on Infrastructure such as railways, power, energy, irrigation etc for Telangana alone. It does not include thousands of crores spent on welfare scheme beneficiaries in Telangana alone. A rough calculation pegs this amount to about 8.3 lakh crores! Am sure such similar numbers exist for Kerala too. The reason so many numbers for Telangana are known is that Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy released a detailed 320 slide presentation with all these numbers to counter the baseless arguments of KCR and his family. The moot point is that these divisive politicians and media are framing the debate in terms of a balance sheet of money alone. And in the garb of making an argument, they are simply falling back on the same lies again and again. The Hindu has been at the forefront of spreading these lies. Pompous editorials and Op-Eds questioning even the “constitutional propriety” of the 15th FC began back in 2018. In fact, this particular article even made the argument that the terms of reference for the 15th Finance Commission could have been silent on which population census to use. The Wire started this lie. The Business Standard picked it up. Not to be left behind, Shekhar Gupta called North India a tax burden on South India. The Hindu has been running it ever since. Divisive politicians have been using these lies to propagate their own agenda. How many more times will The Hindu continue to publish the same lies? Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Rest all is Fake.” He also tagged Disney+ Hotstar in the post. The channel has not released any official statement.The original campaign talks about the ICC Cricket World Cup being streamed for free on Disney+ Hotstar. However, the edited version of the video not only added campaign material in the video but also voiceover-ed the artists acting in the campaign with fake voices. At one point where Kartik says “Freddy main hi hun” to the female artist in the ad, the voiceover replaced the dialogue with “Arre main bhi to Congressi hun”.

39,"22 October, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi spreads propaganda against Agnipath Scheme again by claiming kin of deceased Agniveer soldier will not get anything, here are the facts"," As per the Agnipath Scheme, the next of kin of Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, who died in Siachen, will receive receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amountDays after the Aam Aadmi Party tried to play politics over the death of an Agniveer soldier, now Rahul Gandhi has joined the dirty politics after the death of another Agniveer jawan recruited under the new Agnipath Scheme.On Sunday (22 October), the Indian Army’s Fire and Fury Corps informed that Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman lost his life while posted at Siachen glacier. The corps posted on X, “All ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest condolences to the family.”Quartered in snow silent to remain, when the bugle calls they shall rise and march againAll ranks of Fire and Fury Corps salute the supreme sacrifice of #Agniveer (Operator) Gawate Akshay Laxman, in the line of duty, in the unforgiving heights of #Siachen and offer deepest… pic.twitter.com/1Qo1izqr1UThe reason for the death has not been disclosed, but most tragedies in the glacier take place due to natural disasters like avalanches.Hours after the news of the unfortunate death of the soldier was published, Rahul Gandhi alleged that his family will not get any monetary payment, like the families of regular soldiers receive. In a tweet posted in Hindi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, “A young man was martyred for the country – no gratuity, no other military facilities during his service, and no pension to his family in martyrdom.”He further added that ‘Agniveer is a plan to insult the heroes of India’.However, the allegations of Rahul Gandhi are completely false and inaccurate, and families of Agniveer soldiers who loss their lives in the line of duty do receive emoluments. As per terms of the Agnipath scheme, the Next of Kin of an Agniveer soldier who becomes a battle casualty receives ₹48 Lakh as Non-Contributory Insurance and Ex-gratia of ₹44 Lakh.Apart from this, they also receive the amount of Seva Nidhi contributed by the Agniveer, with an equal matching contribution by the Govt, along with the interest. The Next of Kin will also receive pay for the balance tenure from the date of death, till the completion of four years, which is the term of employment under the scheme. In Gawate Akshay Laxman’s case, his family will receive over ₹13 lakh in total.Not only this, the next of kin will also be paid a contribution of ₹8 Lakh from the Armed Forces Battle Casualty Fund. Therefore, the next of kin of the deceased Agniveer soldier will receive ₹1.13 crore plus the Seva Nidhi amount, which could be around ₹3 lakh for service of one year, as opposed to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that they will receive no monetary compensation.It is notable that the Seva Nidhi contribution is 30% of the salary.Rahul Gandhi has been spreading false propaganda against the Agnipath scheme, designed to turn Indian defence forces into a younger force. He had claimed that the scheme was a brainchild of RSS, alleging that the scheme will create unemployed youths trained in guns, and will create violence in society. It is notable that Rahul Gandhi’s comments were the same as comments of PFI about the scheme, who had claimed that retired Agniveer soldiers would form groups to attack Muslims.Earlier AAP had attacked the scheme after Agniveer Amritpal Singh died in Kashmir, after he was not provided a military guard of honour during his funeral. The Indian Army had then explained that no guard of honour or military funeral was provided because Singh had died from suicide. The Army said that this is the existing policy for all soldiers, not just for Agnivereers.“Unfortunate instances of death arising out of suicide/self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the type of entry, are accorded due respect by the Armed Forces along with deep and enduring empathy with the family. Such cases, however, are not entitled to Military Funerals as per the extant Army Order of 1967, in vogue,” the Indian Army had said.Under the Agnipath scheme, Agniveer soldiers are recruited for 4 years, with 25% of them eligible to enter regular service. Soldiers who retire after four years will be opportunity to work at PSUs, government agencies, paramilitary forces, and state governments. They also receive the Sewa Nidhi corpus of ₹10.04 lakh along with interest.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

A similar protest march in support of Palestinians was taken out by the Kerala-based Welfare Party of India in Kerala on Friday, 20 October in Palakkad in Kerala.However, when the photos and videos of the protest started appearing on social media, people started mocking the Welfare Party of India, saying that it was carrying the flag of Italy instead of the flag of Palestine.

This is because they were carrying neither the Italian flag nor the Palestinian flag, they were carrying the flag of their own party.The flag of the Welfare Party of India has remarkable similarity with the Italian flag, as both the flags are made of vertical panels of green, white and red. However, there is a difference.In the Italian flag, all three panels are blank, but in the WPI flag, there are design elements in the white part in the middle. It has the olive leaves symbol in yellow and the words ‘Welfare Party’ written vertically in black inside the white panel.As the videos shared by the social media users are of low resolution, the yellow leaves symbol is mostly not visible against the white background. But parts of the words ‘Welfare Party’ in black are visible in some of the flags if the videos are observed carefully.Moreover, in other images and videos of the protest posted by the party and others, it is clearly seen that it is the party flag, not the Italian flag.In the video posted in the tweet below, which has better resolution, the yellow leaves symbol and black letters saying ‘Welfare Party’ are clearly seen in the flags carried in a pro-Palestine march by the party in Kozhikode.#Gaza_Genocide#IndiaWithPalestine: Massive rally in Kozhikode, Kerala – India by welfare party of India Kerala against #Israel's atrocities in #Palestine!Hundreds join in solidarity with #Gaza, chanting slogans like '#FreePalestine' and 'Stop #Gaza_Genocide'! pic.twitter.com/qE3ElKVkacTherefore, while the Welfare Party’s support for Palestinians is questionable given the horrific terror attack on Israel, the party didn’t make any mistake in picking the flag for the protest.

42,"2 November, 2023 ","Israeli parliamentarian slams Rajdeep Sardesai for equating Hamas terror attack with Israel’s military action, says won’t allow govt to stop until Hamas is eliminated"," Boaz Bismuth made it clear that it is Israel's duty to protect its people and thus the country is entitled to end terrorism.On Wednesday (1st November) IndiaToday journalist Rajdeep Sardesai attempted to draw parallels between Israel’s retaliatory action in Gaza with Hamas’s terrorist attack in Israel on the 7th of October. Boaz Bismuth, an Israeli MP blasted Sardesai for drawing parallels between a terrorist attack and a country’s military action against terrorism.During his program on IndiaToday discussing Israel’s bombing of the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza on Wednesday Rajdeep asked, “There seems to be a dehumanisation taking place on both sides..”To this, the Israeli MP raised strong objection saying that he would not allow anyone to make parallels between Hamas’s terror attacks and Israeli war against terrorism. “A..If I (Israel) didn’t care about their lives, I wouldn’t send my planes and soldiers. B. I tell civilians to get out of the buildings (controlled by terrorists). C… terrorists are going under the hospitals because they know that I won’t attack a hospital. You interviewed the person who spoke about the hostages…she said also in Israel they have got thousands of people in their jails. Yes, we have terrorists, what do they have…six months babies,” the Israeli lawmaker said.After a failed attempt at guilt-tripping the Israeli representative, Rajdeep Sardesai asked him if the Hamas terrorists release the hostages, will there be a ceasefire from the Israeli side. In response to this, Boaz Bismuth made it clear that it is Israel’s duty to protect its people and thus the country is entitled to end terrorism.When asked if the same morality applies to the Palestinian children and if they too have the same rights as Israeli children, Bismuth reminded Sardesai that, unlike Hamas terrorists, Israeli forces are not entering Palestine and killing children. “Did you see my soldiers going and slaughtering Palestinian children…what are you talking about?”Sardesai was somehow trying to establish that in the war between Hamas and Israel, the Palestinian people are suffering. However, he conveniently forgot that it was the same Palestinian people who elected Hamas to the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) in the 2006 elections giving them 74 out of 132 seats despite knowing that it was a terrorist group in the barb of a ‘political party’. The Israeli lawmaker reminded Sardesai of the same and said, “In 2006 when they had elections, knowing that Hamas is a terrorist group, knowing that Hamas wants to eliminate Israel as a nation, knowing that Hamas wants to renew this Islamic Jihad…70 per cent of Gaza people voted for them. And although they did that Israel is not attacking civilians. Israel has nothing against civilians but has everything against terrorism.”I will not allow my government to stop until Hamas is over: @BismuthBoaz, Israel MP @sardesairajdeep #NewsToday pic.twitter.com/Qm32Nhgdl9Responding to Sardesai’s claims that over 5000 people have died in Palestine since the country declared war on Hamas, Boaz Bismuth called out the hypocrisy of how the world sees it when the West, the “civilised world” attacks terrorism and Israel does the same. He went on to explain how Israel’s war on Hamas is also a war of India, the US and any country that cares for the Palestinian people as he said: “If you really care for Palestinian people, you should eliminate a terrorist group like Hamas because who is behind what is happening in Gaza right now. Its Hamas! If they hadn’t come inside our villages, our houses and then we would never have responded like that..”Despite the Israeli lawmaker emphasising the necessity to uproot Hamas completely, Rajdeep Sardesai seemed keen on pushing for a ceasefire. In response, Bismuth reiterated that as not only an MP but also as a citizen he would not want his government to declare a ceasefire until Hamas is eliminated. He also reminded Sardesai that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has not yet condemned Hamas’s terrorist attacks that left 1400 Israelis including children and the elderly dead, and women raped. Highlighting the difference between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists, Boaz Bismuth said that when Hamas kills Israeli children, they celebrate, on the other hand, if somehow Palestinian children suffer due to Israeli action by mistake, the Israeli soldiers cry for those children. Sardesai wrapped the Gaza debate as the Israeli lawmaker and former journalist pointed out that Jews after getting their promised land focused on their welfare, technology medicines and other aspects while Hamas focused on terrorism.Interestingly, liberals, Islamists and Palestine sympathisers in general across the world have been pushing this narrative that Hamas is an armed ‘resistance’ group and that it is the innocent Palestinian civilians who are suffering atrocities while Hamas and Israel clash. However, several surveys conducted over the last few years, suggest that the Palestinian people overwhelmingly support the Islamist terrorist group Hamas. As per a survey released in 2021, Palestinian support for Hamas surged dramatically following the Gaza war in May of that year. As reported earlier, the scientific poll conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) found that around three-quarters of Palestinians viewed Hamas terrorists as victors in a battle against Israel.Similarly, in the 2019 PCPSR survey, it was found that if Palestinian presidential elections were to be held between President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, 41 per cent of Palestinians would vote for Haniyeh. 48 per cent of Palestinians expressed support for a two-state solution. In the 2018 PCPSR survey, 49 per cent of Palestinians said they would vote for Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh for President. A Washington Institute survey this year showed that 57 per cent of Gazans had a positive opinion of Hamas with similar percentages of Palestinians in the West Bank (52%) and East Jerusalem (64%).It is worth noting that while Palestine sympathisers like Rajdeep Sardesai and Hamas supporting Islamists globally are demanding a ‘ceasefire’, a top Hamas terrorist Ghazi Hamad not only justified the brutal terror attack in Israel on October 7 killing thousands of civilians including children and the elderly and raping women parading them naked but also announced to repeat it until Israel is annihilated completely.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

They are part of the Palestinian Liberation Movement. They are the most influential organisation there. My party has differences about the approach of Hamas, but Hamas is one of the militant streams.""On 30th October, Congress’ spokesperson Lavanya Ballal Jain, Community Party of India – Marxist (CPI-M) leader MA Baby and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader MK Muneer refused to call Hamas a terrorist organisation during a debate on India Today moderated by Rajdeep Sardesai. They also refused to condemn the Hamas leader addressing a rally in Kerala and went round and round in circles over the question.During the debate, Sardesai and other panellists consistently targeted Union Minister Rajiv Chandrashekhar, claiming he connected the Kerala blast at the convention centre to a Hamas rally. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla repeatedly clarified that the minister did not connect the dots as it was being claimed. Still, he drew parallels that such rallies and incidents point towards the possibility of radicalisation.Moving on, Congress spokesperson Lavanya Ballal Jain was questioned by Sardesai if the Congress party condemned the terrorist attack in Israel, what is happening in Gaza and the Solidarity Youth Movement rally that took place in Kerala where former Hamas chief Khaled Mashal addressed the crowd. Lavanya kept going round and round in her answer. Still, she neither condemned Hamas’ terror attack on Israel nor did she give a clear answer on Hamas’s leader addressing a rally in Kerala.""Attack on civilians/innocent people is against international law..it is a crime"": MK Muneer, Muslim League leader Should the rally be allowed where a Hamas leader was addressing? Answers @LavanyaBallal, Cong spokesperson#NewsToday #Kerala #Blasts | @sardesairajdeep pic.twitter.com/LyzIVLRPoQShe said that holding a rally is a fundamental right of every Indian. However, she pointed out that there has been no communal tension on record in Kerala for the past five years. She said there had been no communal tension, but “we are jumping to declare that Kerala is a Tinder Box. Kerala is becoming communally sensitive. Let’s also be very clear that there has been no communal violence in the state in the last five and a half years, and most of the communal violence incidents have happened in the Hindi speaking States, especially in the BJP ruled States.”Sardesai asked CPI(M) leader MA Baby how the rally by the Solidarity Youth Movement (SYM) was allowed when former Hamas chief Khaled Mashal addressed the crowd. SYM is the youth wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami organisation.In his reply, MA Baby cited freedom of speech and said any legal organisation is free to hold rallies for any cause, including for Palestinians or any other “liberation movement”. He further refused to acknowledge the contents of the speech by the Hamas leader and said whatever was being talked about in the media was just speculation over what he said. He further emphasised the fact that Hamas is not a banned organisation in India. He further asserted that it was unclear if there was any element of radicalisation in the speech.Notably, on 9th October, MA Baby extended his support for Hamas and said, “If you are labelling Hamas a terrorist organisation, then you will have to accept the fact that Israel also is a terrorist country. The time has come to declare Palestine as an independent country with eastern Jerusalem as its capital.” This statement was pointed out during the debate by BJP’s spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla, who said it justified what Hamas did on 7th October.Denying calling Hamas a terrorist outfit, MA Baby said, “Hamas is now the elected representative of the Gaza region. They are part of the Palestinian Liberation Movement. They are the most influential organisation there. My party has differences about the approach of Hamas, but Hamas is one of the militant streams.”He further cited United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterrers’ statement where he said, “It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled, their people displaced, and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.”MA Baby used the statement to justify the Hamas terrorist attack on Gaza, saying even the UN justified it. However, he completely skipped on the fact that just a day after the statement, Guterres himself said his statement was misrepresented, and in no way was it justification for what Hamas did in Israel on 7th October.Sardesai questioned IUML leader ML Muneer if he unequivocally condemned what happened on 7th October. On that day, the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas initiated the largest terror attack on Israel, killing around 1,300 Israelis and foreigners, including children, elderly and women. Over 200 were taken hostage by Hamas.Replying to his question, Muneer asserted that whatever happened on 7th October was not out of the blue but a reaction to what had been happening to Palestinians for decades. Rooting for whataboutery, Muneer continued and said under international law, killing any civilians is against the law. However, “What Israel has done in retaliation to this, killed 7,000. Out of 7,000, 4,000 are children. Are they a member of Hamas?” Muneer echoed the same narrative that Hamas did not attack Israel in a vacuum during the debate.On 27th October, Khaled Mashal, the former chief of the terrorist organisation Hamas, virtually addressed a ‘solidarity event’ organised by the Solidarity Youth Movement. The group is the youth wing of the extremist Jamaat-e-Islami Hind outfit. The terrorist leader reportedly called for the annihilation of Hinduism and Zionism in his address. In his speech, Khalid asked people present at the rally to extend unconditional support to Hamas and made anti-Hindu comments. Anti-Hindu slogans were raised in the rally held in Malappuram, and the audience is heard applauding the address of Khaled Mashal playing on a large screen. They supported his call and vowed to support Hamas terrorists.On 7th October (local time), Hamas launched the worst terrorist attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,300 Israelis and foreign nationals, including children, the elderly and women. Over 200 people were taken hostage by the Hamas terrorists. Women were raped, children were killed in front of their parents, the elderly were shot dead point black in their homes, Israeli soldiers were killed, and the terrorists mutilated their bodies during the attack. Israel launched a counter-strike on Hamas. So far, around 8,000 lives have been lost in Israeli air strikes. Israel has warned the civilians multiple times to evacuate, but reports suggest that Hamas terrorists kept stopping them. Meanwhile, India launched Operation Ajay to rescue Indians from Israel. On 1st November, the Israel-Hamas war entered its 25th day.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

44,"1 November, 2023 ","The Hindu’s English Magazine ‘FrontLine’ and its Editor decide to officially be Hamas-collaborators: The shameful justification of rape, torture and beheading"," This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War. The Hindu’s fortnightly magazine ‘Frontline’ has now officially taken a stand justifying and whitewashing the atrocities committed by Hamas against Israel’s civilian population on the 7th of October 2023. In an ‘editors note’ published on the 30th of October, FrontLine essentially responded to why it refuses to condemn Islamic terror outfit Hamas. This ‘Frontline’ perhaps felt the need to justify its support to terror after the Israeli Ambassador to India had written a scathing open letter to The Hindu for interviewing Mousa Abu Marzouk – a Hamas official. The Editor of Frontline, Vaishna Roy, took to X to share the despicable note that she penned in the magazine. Editor’s Note: ""When one hears Israeli leaders use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies and accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play."" @frontline_india https://t.co/tj5XXdgX1XThe note by Roy essentially starts by insinuating that the Jews, who were the victims of the Holocaust, have now morphed into the perpetrators of the same atrocities against other people – Palestinians. Roy writes, “When one hears Israeli leaders repeatedly use the word “Nazi” to describe their enemies, repeatedly accuse Palestinian supporters of being anti-Semitic, repeatedly claim that their powerhouse of a nation is the victim, one sees the deep psychological displacement at play. The Zionists have taken their generational rage and turned it not against the powerful West, whose arms and support they need, but against the hapless people on whose lands they have settled”.At the very outset, Roy sets the base to justify the terrorism that claimed the lives of women, children and the elderly on the 7th of October 2023 when Hamas, for over 8 hours, went on a rampage of unbridled violence against the Israeli civilian population. Not only does she equate the victims – the Jews – to the perpetrators of their genocide – the Nazis, but also insinuates that anti-semitism is a figment of their imagination – a sentiment of absolute hate the world has seen play out during various “protest marches” by Muslims, chanting for the annihilation of Jews. The crafty insinuation which was far more telling was her snicker at the fact that a “powerhouse of a nation” can ever claim to be the victim. Essentially what Roy was saying is that because Israel is financially and militarily far superior to several nations across the world, it can never claim itself to be the victim of terrorism. Perhaps it would help Roy to understand how terrorism works. Powerful nations with economic and military might win wars owing to that power, however, wars like the one Israel is fighting are generally ‘after the fact’. Terrorist groups and terror nations don’t particularly stick to rules of engagement, international conventions and military ethics. They are human bombs whose sole aim is to inflict damage, for the sake of their vengeful God. What makes them far more dangerous is that death in the process of fighting these “powerful nations”, which are viewed to be the enemies of their fanatic religious campaign, is in itself a reward by their God. When a “powerful nation” is faced with religious mercenaries for whom death itself is a religious reward by God himself, and the worst atrocities against innocent people a not only a tool to achieve that reward but also ordained by their scripture, the “powerful nation” and their people are the victims – notwithstanding their economic or military might. Essentially, the asymmetrical battle is between an all-powerful nation and an all-powerful, vengeful God – a claim by Roy’s mythical ‘victims’ themselves. The ‘all-powerful nation’ is bound by the rules of a civilised nation. Those who fight for an ‘all-powerful God’ adhere to no rules of the civilised world. They adhere to the rules set by their all-powerful God – a God which allows them, nay, ordains them, to murder those who don’t believe in him in the most brutal way known to man. A modern powerful nation is no match to those who believe in a medieval religious war. They never were. They never will be. Europe, which prided itself on being the birthplace of modernity and at one point ruled the entire world is learning this lesson bit by bit – the lessons are brutal, bloody and excruciating – a pain that, according to the ‘faithfuls’, they are destined to endure. Vaishna Roy wants Israelis to die with a smile on their face because they are rich, being murdered by those perceived to be poor – that is not how the world works – except in a communist’s deranged head. Roy in her note counts the dead bodies and compares those lost by Israel and Palestine. She writes, “Yom Kippur, 1973, saw 2,700 Israeli deaths and 19,000 Arab/Palestinian deaths. In the First Lebanon War, the numbers were 1,200 and 20,000. First Intifada: 179 and 1,200; Second Intifada: 900 and 3,300. The four Gaza Wars: 144 Israeli deaths and 4,800 Palestinian deaths. As this goes to press, the corresponding numbers for the ongoing war are 1,400 and 7,300, respectively. Hamas has stones, homemade rockets, tractors, and motorcycles. Israel has the world’s most sophisticated weapons. Israel is a nuclear nation while the Palestinians barely have a nation. Wasn’t it Voltaire who said killing is a crime unless you “kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets”?”What Roy writes here summarily exposes how she has, summarily, decided to be an ally of Islamic Jihad. The Yom Kippur War, for example, was a surprise attack by the Arab-Egypt coalition. It is also known as the Ramadan war because the ‘faithfuls’ believe it is their religious duty to fight and kill the infidels and that holy war, becomes a bit sweeter if the death and destruction are caused on the non-believer’s religious observance day. That Israel was simply better at mounting an offensive, causing more casualties to those who started the war, does not take away from the fact that they were the ones who were attacked. What is far more telling is that Roy even counts the deaths during the Intifadas. The Intifadas were, again, religious wars where the riots and violence were initiated by the Jihadis and sustained by them as well. During the first four years of the Intifada, more than 3,600 Molotov cocktail attacks, 100 hand grenade attacks and 600 assaults with guns or explosives were reported by the Israel Defense Forces. The violence was directed at soldiers and civilians alike. During this period, 16 Israeli civilians and 11 soldiers were killed by Palestinians in the territories; more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and 1,700 Israeli soldiers were injured. Approximately 1,100 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli troops.There was instigation from the mosques of Palestine to kill Jews, justification for the genocide of their people and everything that we see the world over when the innocent faithfuls decide to rise against the infidels. After the unbridled violence by Jihadis, Israel defended itself. That defence in itself becomes a reason for Roy to dismiss assertions of the Jews being the victims of Jihad. Vaishna Roy’s shameless apologia for Jihad becomes painfully obvious as she concludes her note. She writes the following: “We are being harangued to condemn Hamas, but Hamas was not begotten in a vacuum. It was born from the bloody union of broken promises and daily humiliations, settler violence and soldier atrocities. Hamas was midwifed when basic humanitarian values were aborted. When UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said exactly this, pointing to the “56 years of suffocating occupation” the Palestinian people have suffered, Israel called for his resignation”, she says. Before we dissect what she has written, let us recap how this war started – what happened on the 7th of October 2023. On the 7th, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. There are painful eyewitness accounts of women being raped, dismembered, burnt alive and tortured, There are testimonies of babies, and toddlers being burnt alive, dismembered, shot and killed. There are testimonies and documented evidence of the brutality that Hamas inflicted. Beheadings. Rapes. Murders. Tortures. Kidnappings and worse – amidst chants of Allahu Akbar. After the terror attack by Hamas, Israel decided to defend itself and unleashed its military might to ensure Hamas – a terrorist organisation – is wiped out. Israel was defending its citizens and also attempting to recover the hundreds of hostages that Hamas had taken. What is pertinent to remember here that Hamas knew this was a war they would not win. They knew that their treacherous attack would lead to Israel using its military might to ensure the hostages were freed and also, that Hamas was wiped off the face of the earth. They still chose to attack Israeli citizens because that is the zealotry that Holy Wars inspire among the followers of the all-powerful God. Vaishna Roy essentially says that the Jews are Nazis because they chose to retaliate after women, children, babies and the elderly were tortured by Islamic terrorists. In the same breath, she also says that her magazine will simply not condemn Hamas because their action is a result of oppression. The reduction of that is simple – Hamas has a right to rape, torture, and behead civilians because they have supposedly been oppressed. They should not be condemned, rather, their barbarity must be understood in context. The language of the victims, so to speak. However, when those being raped, tortured and beheaded decide to say “thus far and no further”, they automatically become Nazis deserving annihilation because any form of retaliation against the Jihadis is “collective punishment” which further victimises the very Jihadis who raped, tortured and beheaded to avenge the oppression that the rapists and murderers experienced, leading them to rape, behead and torture innocent civilians. Further, it is evident that Roy is not particlarly concerned about the lives of Palestinians. If she were, she would, ideally be, a voice against Hamas. Hamas is no friend of the Palestinians. They use Palestinians as human shields, especially children, make hundreds of kilometers of tunnels were civilians are not allowed to take shelter, use aid money to buy weapons and deprive the Palestinians of a normal life. Even if we choose to ignore that Palestinians themselves overwhelmingly support Hamas, if Roy was so concerned, she should be picking her pen up to fight against Hamas, not be their ally. This may seem like intellectual masturbation at best and harakiri at worst, however, it is far more sinister than one imagines – sinister beyond just the context of Israel and Palestine. The overarching and blanket classification of all Muslims as the perennially oppressed endorses their delusion that owing to this mythical oppression, they are allowed to carry out their blood lust for those who refuse to believe in their all-powerful God. Every atrocity, every act of violence, every beheading, every rape, every riot, every stone thrown, every molotov cocktail hurled, every woman stripped, every baby killed, every innocent tortured, every person dismembered is the “language of the oppressed” and therefore, is not only pardonable but even understandable, or worse, acceptable. This delusion of Hamas collaborators like Vaishna Roy puts every Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Christian, Parsi, Sikh etc at the risk of an impending genocide. This delusion of Jihadi collaborators like Vaishna Roy will ensure that when the next genocide happens, it is contextualised and supported in the name of vengeance for those who used the blanket victimhood handed over to them by these very Jihadi collaborators as a convenient excuse for their Holy War.

Although he apologised for his remarks in 2019, it becomes clear that his upbringing in a diverse, multicultural society could not rid him of his disdain for non-Muslims.Gentle reminder that Mehdi Hasan has previously characterized non-Muslims as immoral people who “live their lives like animals,” and lumped homosexuals together with pedophiles and sexual deviants in his speeches: pic.twitter.com/ZX7b71EvSJIn April 2022, the MSNBC anchor went on a tirade against PM Modi and cast aspersions on India’s secularism.“Putin.

ASI officials said the new batch of 1,414 objects is likely to include non-antiquities as well, and will be ranked accordingly, keeping the definition of ""antiquity"" in mind.A batch of 1,414 antiquities is set to return to India from the United States. Reports citing government sources claim that the objects have already been given to the Consulate General of India in New York.The antiquities will include objects displayed in New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met Museum). Sources say that as per procedure, a team from the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) is being sent to the US for verification of the objects, after which the repatriation process can be initiated.USA offers back 1400 #Murtis and antiquities to Bharat. Literally the biggest restitution ever. Unimaginable before HPM @narendramodi Govt. 👏👏@kishanreddybjp @M_Lekhi 🙏#BringOurGodsHome @IndiaPrideProj https://t.co/KWSuiUSPxOThe ASI team will also authenticate the objects as “antiquities” or “non-antiquities”. ASI officials said the new batch of 1,414 objects is likely to include non-antiquities as well, and will be ranked accordingly, keeping the definition of “antiquity” in mind.No specific details regarding their age or region have been provided to the ASI at this stage. However, the US authorities have reportedly said that the 1,414 objects from different sources seem to be of “Indian provenance”.As per the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972, antiquity is defined as “any coin, sculpture, painting, epigraph or other work of art or craftsmanship; any article, object or thing detached from a building or cave; any article, object or thing illustrative of science, art, crafts, literature, religion, customs, morals or politics in bygone ages; any article, object or thing of historical interest” that “has been in existence for not less than 100 years”.Non-antiquities are generally decorative objects and idols, or replicas of original art objects used for ornamental purposes.A joint investigation by The Indian Express in March revealed that a treasure trove at the Met was traced to antique dealer Subhash Kapoor, who was serving a prison term in Tamil Nadu for smuggling antiquities.On 22nd March, the Supreme Court of the State of New York had issued a warrant against the Met giving the authorities ten days to seize the antiquities.On 30th March, the Met had issued a statement saying it would “transfer 15 sculptures for return to the Government of India, after having learned that the works were illegally removed from India”. 10 of the 15 items in the search warrant were flagged in The Indian Express report.Earlier, in July, the Indian government had said the objects from the Met were expected to arrive in the next three to six months. 105 antiquities were handed over by the US authorities to the Indian Consulate in New York on 17th July, and repatriated to India in August. The Met’s objects were not among them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

47,"19 October, 2023 ",Ram Mandir: 51-inch Balswaroop idol to be handed over to the Temple trust by 31st October," The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.The decades-long wait of Hindu devotees is going to end in January 2024. The construction work of the Bhavya Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi is progressing rapidly. In May, the Ram Janmabhoomi temple trust announced that three sculptors are making the Ram Lalla statue to be placed in the Garbhagriha. A member of one of the three teams, Vipin Bhadouriya recently informed that the 51-inch tall Balswaroop idol will be handed over to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple trust by 31st October. Bhadouriya asserted, “The statue of Ramlalla, which will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ayodhya’s Ram temple, is almost complete and will be handed over to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust by 31st October.” Bhadouriya has been working around the clock with his mentor, Ganesh Bhatt, who is an eminent sculptor from Karnataka. Regarding Ramlalla’s idol, Bhadouriya noted, “Our idol made of black stone will be the world’s most beautiful statue of Lord Ram, more beautiful than what was imagined. The beauty of the idol would leave people mesmerised.” He further highlighted that the idol depicts a balswaroop Ram, as a five-year-old, standing on a lotus, carrying a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. Additionally, the statue would also have fine carvings and designs. All signs related to Lord Ram are carved on the statue which will be 51 inches tall.Bhadouriya added, “I am happy that our efforts have yielded some good results. Our work is on the verge of completion. After some finishing touches, the idol will be handed over to the trust by the end of this month.” However, he is not the only one who is preparing the Ram Lalla idol. In May, General Secretary Champat Rai said, “The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones.” #WATCH | Ayodhya, UP: The construction work of the idol of Ram Lalla has started. Dr Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, Satya Narayan Pandey from Jaipur, and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka are making idols at three different places on three different stones. It is expected that the idol… pic.twitter.com/0PBCgjXbP0According to the Trust officials, the finest Ram Lalla idol would be placed in the ‘garbhagriha’, while the remaining two would be placed in another temple. The Ram Lalla idols are being made based on the sketch of internationally acclaimed artist Vasudeo Kamath. He hails from Karnataka’s Karkala town and his paintings from the Ramayana series are acclaimed worldwide.Meanwhile, out of the three sculptors, two — Bhadouriya and his mentor Bhatt, and Arun Yogiraj from Mysore – have used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore.According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting. A trust official said, “The stone, weighing 10 tonnes, 6 feet wide, 4 feet thick, and almost one foot long, was specially brought from Nellikaru village in Karkala, almost a month ago.” Whereas the third team comprising Satya Narayan Pandey and his son Shilpi from Jaipur is carving the Ram Lalla statue from ‘A-class’ stone or marble from Makrana. Regarding the usage of Makrana marble, Officials said, “Makrana marble is used for its durability, translucency and fine grains. It is ‘weatherproof’, as it is resistant to erosion and weathering, which makes it ideal for outdoor sculptures and statues.”However, it is important to note that the trust is not using the two Shaligram stones, weighing 14 and 26 tonnes, which arrived from Nepal on 2nd January, for the construction of the Ram Lalla idol.Regarding this Champat Rai said, “The two Devshilas were gifted to us by Nepal. These stones were calcite and quartzite and were procured from the Gandaki River in the Muktinath area of the Himalayan region. However, after consulting many seers, priests, and experts, the trust decided not to use the Devshila from Nepal. It was a difficult decision to take.” The trust has not yet finalised what will be done with Devshila.Further, the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust officials also elaborated on the procedure that will be followed prior to the consecration (pran pratishtha) ceremony of the idol, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi would take part, on 22nd January.According to the officials, a grand procession will be taken out through the streets of Ayodhya and the Ram Lalla idol will be placed on a special chariot that is under construction. The trust officials said, “The scholars from Kashi will worship River Saryu and give a holy dip to the idol amid the chants of special mantras and hymns. On the final day, the idol will be installed in the garbhagriha.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

49,"15 October, 2023 ","Navratri: Festival of women’s power whose religious, cultural, economic and scientific aspects are equally important, read the significance of Garba"," Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained.India is a wonderful country where all occasions and festivals are observed with grandeur. Diverse folk traditions are seen from different regions in this colourful country. The sophisticated and magnificent culture of affluent India is formed through the fusion of many indigenous customs. Sanatana Dharma’s core principle is that we are able to gain fresh knowledge throughout our festivities which offer a rational perspective as well and Navratri is one such event which falls on 15 October of this year. Let us tell you about Navratri’s cultural, religious and scientific significance and explain why it is known as the celebration of women’s power.Cultural and religious significance of NavratriNavratri has a special significance across the country, especially in Gujarat. The worshippers of Goddess Shakti observe a nine-day fast and play Garba during the nights. Many consider Garba as a form of entertainment which is performed for fun, however, that is not the case. Navratri has a special significance in spiritualism and is dedicated to the worship of Goddess Parashakti. It is not for enjoying and doing Garba and Dandiya only. Garba is but one method of worshipping Goddess Shakti and growing closer to her. The importance of dance has been described in the ancient Vedic tradition. There are numerous paths that lead to God and Garba is one of them. Therefore, it is first and foremost important to understand and accept that the Ras-Garba on Navratri is not just for leisure, but a vital component of our religious and cultural history.Religious history states that a demon by the name of Mahishasura once sat to perform penance for Lord Brahma. He demanded to be immortal after the latter was pleased and told him to ask for a blessing. However, he was directed to seek another one because immortality was against the law of nature. Afterwards, he requested a boon that neither a god nor a demon or a human could kill him and only a woman would be able to end his life which was granted.Mahishasura rose to power over time and eventually began waging war against the gods who fought unitedly against him but were unable to put a halt to his reign of terror after which Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu were pleaded for assistance. However, it was not possible to defeat the demon because of the boon bestowed upon him. As a result, all of them including Lord Vishnu began to call upon Goddess Adishakti and a heavenly light that emanated from their bodies gave her a physical form.Mahishasura and Goddess Shakti engaged in combat despite the fact that he was destined to die at her hands. The war lasted for nine days and she defeated him on the tenth day and the festival of Navaratri came into existence ever since. Vijayadashami is commemorated after the conclusion of the auspicious nine days to mark the day the ferocious demon was eliminated. Notably, the day is also celebrated as Dussehra because Lord Ram killed demon king Ravan on the same day. Vijayadashami is an observance of the triumph of Dharma over evil.Scientific RelevanceThe scientific value of Navratri is linked to both its religious and cultural significance. The festival coincides with the intersection of two seasons which has scientific merit. There is a sandhikaal (end of one season and beginning of another) during both Navratris of the year. The body’s adjustment to speech, phlegm and bile generally goes through phases of improvement and decline during this time which affects the immune system. This is the reason that nine days are dedicated to chanting, fasting, purification of the body, cleaning, meditation, havan and other practices to prevent multiple illnesses and have a clean environment.Economic ImportanceAnother very significant aspect of Navratri is its fiscal impact. Hindu events also have a substantial economic component. The income of those who create garba and diyas (clay Lamps) begins to rise at the start of Navratri. Garba is a celebration of the festival of goddess that is participated in by all devotees and it provides employment to the people who make earthen pots and lamps.Moreover, the way people dress traditionally during Navratri is also crucial and benefits those who create the outfits. Several people find work through both little and large purchases. People who produce or sell snacks, sweets, fruits and religious items, for instance, have considerable possibilities for work during Navratri. Therefore, it is equally important to take into account the financial implications of the festival.Importance of ‘Women Power’The significance of women power outweighs the religious, cultural and monetary worth of Navratri by multiple factors. Adishakti pervades the atom and governs the whole universe. Feminity or power of women is also a component of the goddess. A person’s strength is their potential and no work is possible without shakti (power) which is of unique importance in the entire world. Hence, it is worshipped in different places in various ways. It’s recognised as power energy by science. It is known as Shakti or even divine energy in the ancient Vedic faith. According to the Rig Veda, the universe in its entirety originated with a singular power and per science the universe is composed of one energy. The power of women brought prominence to the world just as the universe has emerged from the primal power. Therefore, women power is regarded as an expression of Adishakti.Navratri also serves as a celebration of female empowerment. Navratri is also considered dedicated to women power. Girls are worshipped on the day of Durgashtami and Mahanavami on the occasion of Navratri as they are considered to be the form of Goddess Durga. There is a custom of worshipping one to nine girls between the ages of 2 years to 10 years during the festival.The entire cosmos could not have been created without Goddess Durga who is nature and divinity. She is oxygen and completes Lord Shiva. Shiva and Shakti come together to form Ardhanarishvar (lord who is half feminine). Since Navratri is dedicated to women power and respects them. The fast and Durga Puja would be futile if one offends his mother, sister, wife, daughter or another female during this festival. Hence, Navratri imparts the essential message of honouring all women.Significance of GarbaThe word Garba is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘Garbhdeep’. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated significantly in recent times. The popularity of playing garba among young people has elevated tremendously in recent times. If we look at the intriguing background of this well-known and fascinating folk dance, we discover that doing Garba was formerly only a tradition in Rajasthan and Gujarat (notably Saurashtra and Kutch). However, it gained popularity and spread to other parts of India. Now, people take part in Garba all around the country. Garba programs are organised in temples and houses. Nine holes are punched into Garba and it is placed in the centre and everyone plays Raas-Garba around it. Nowadays, large Garba festivals are hosted by various organisations in which people participate.The holes represent the shape of the human body while the lamp therein symbolises the flame form of the soul. The former indicates the nine doors of the human body which include the two eyes, two ears, two noses (nostrils), mouth, anus and genitalia. A person’s soul exits their body through any of these openings when they die. A lamp is continuously lit for nine days with the conviction that the self-flame is perpetually ignited.Apart from this, 27 holes are made in Garba in many places, however, the mystery of it is unknown. Garba is viewed as a representation of the universe and the 27 pores (9 in 3 lines) are interpreted as a depiction of the 27 constellations and each of them has 4 phases through which the number 27 X 4 = 108 is obtained. Therefore, it is believed that rotating the Garbi 108 times by placing the Garba in the middle is equal to the virtue of circumambulating the universe.Method and tradition of worshipNine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Navratri. Each day is dedicated to the worship of a different form. The nine manifestations of the goddess are Shailputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skanda Mata, Katyayani, Kalratri, Maha Gauri and Siddhidatri. Goddess Durga along with her family, based on religious beliefs, rode her Vahan (carrier/vehicle) from Kailash to Earth on the first day of Navratri. It is crucial to invoke the goddess during the Navratri fast. Invocation means inviting the deity into the house for a specific goal or accomplishment. The installation of the Kumbhasthapana or Kalash comes first in the procedure of worshipping Goddess Shakti. It must be installed if one fast for nine days during Navratri and should do the same even on the first or the day of Ashtami. According to the Devi Purana, it is very important to establish a Kalash in the house before worshipping Goddess Bhagavati. It is erected during worship as an image of the goddess’s strength and as a site of pilgrimage. The Kalash is viewed as a representation of wealth, joy and elegance. Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva and the heavenly mother force all reside in it.The worship of Goddess Shakti can take place in multiple ways and there are numerous methods to do it which comprise yajna-yagya (ritual done in front of a sacred fire), havan (sacred purification ritual), vrat (fast), japa (meditative repetition of a mantra or a divine name), tapa (asceticism, spiritual discipline) and dhyana (meditation) among other things are performed. Chandipath, BhavanyaShtakam and Shakradaya Stuti have a very special significance in Navratri. Yajna is carried out during Navratri at any divine religious place. It is a method in the Vedic tradition that displays a profound mysticism and the culmination of spiritual power.Note: Read the report in Gujarati here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

50,"4 November, 2023 ",Statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to be inaugurated in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kupwara near LoC on November 7," This year, on the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde will celebrate a Diwali feast program with the soldiers at the same place.An equestrian statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is installed in Kupwara, Jammu and Kashmir. The statue will be inaugurated by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday (November 7). On this occasion, the water of all the rivers on the Kanyakumari-Kashmir route will be collected and the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj will be anointed by it. The statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is installed along the Line of Control near Kupwara.Maharashtra’s Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Maharashtra’s Cultural Affairs Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and army officers will be present at the puja. Rajesh Kshirsagar, executive chairman of the Maharashtra State Planning Board, and Hemant Jadhav, president of ‘Amhi Punekar’ (We Punekars) NGO held a press conference to provide this information. Trustees of the institute including Abhayraj Shirole, Milind Pawar, and Akhil Jhanjale were present at this time.Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and the head of the Yedtore Mutt, Mysore – Sri Sri Shankar Bharathi Mahaswamiji are scheduled to attend the inauguration ceremony. The equestrian statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was flagged off from Mumbai Raj Bhavan to Kupwara on 20th October, accompanied by drum beats and chants of “Jai Bhavani Jai Shivaji”. Maharashtra Governor Ramesh Bais accompanied by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Minister of Cultural Affairs Sudhir Mungantiwar flagged off the statue. The statue completed a journey of approximately 2200 km before reaching Kupwara, where the soldiers extended an extraordinary welcome to the revered figure of the Maratha icon. The Rashtriya Rifles and 41 Maratha Light Infantry Regiment based in Kupwara received the King’s statue.Rajesh Kshirsagar said, “The Maharashtra government will extend all necessary support for the memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj at Kupwara.

51,"4 November, 2023 ","Explained: What is Electoral Bonds Scheme, how it works, and why govt says it is essential to ensure transparency & white money in political funding"," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta warned that if the scheme is scrapped, it will result in the return to days of funding of parties by cash, which makes preventing black money flowing into the political system impossible.On 2 November, the Supreme Court of India asked the Election Commission of India to submit details of electoral bonds received by political parties, giving the poll panel 2 weeks to furnish the data. The order came in the hearing of petitions challenging the validity of electoral bonds. The Supreme Court of India started hearing the petitions on 31st October and reserved its judgement.The electoral bonds are used by donors to make financial contributions to political parties. The government of India issued a notification in 2018 launching electoral bonds for donations to the political parties. These bonds provide anonymity to the donors. One of the main aims behind launching the bonds was to eradicate the black money infusion into politics. The electoral bonds are issued by banks, which means the funds donated to political parties go through the banking system, even though the identity of the donor is not disclosed. Therefore, it ensures that only legitimate money is donated to parties. However, those who have filed petitions against such bonds claim that these bonds do not provide a level playing field to the political parties. It is claimed BJP corners the majority of bonds.On 2nd January 2018, the government of India introduced the Electoral Bond Scheme. The idea was to enhance the transparency in political funding and stop using black money in politics. The Electoral Bonds are interest-free bearer instruments that are available in various denominations. Indian citizens and incorporated Indian entities can buy these bonds from specific State Bank of India branches.As per the notification issued by the Government of India, one has to adhere to KYC norms to purchase Electoral Bonds. Once bought, these bonds have to be donated to registered political parties within a 15-day window. The purchase period for the bonds occurs in January, April, July and October. However, during General Elections, there is a provision for an additional 30-day extension period for purchasing and making donations to the political parties.The eligible political parties that receive donations via such bonds can encash the bonds through designated bank accounts. The donations through Electoral Bonds promote a more transparent and accountable system for political contributions.The name and other information of the donor are not men mentioned on the instrument and thus electoral bonds are said to be anonymous. But the party that receives the bonds knows who donated them, as they have to delivered physically. Is there a cap on the number of electoral bonds that a person or a company can purchase?As per the rules, there is no cap on the number of electoral bonds that a person or a company can purchase. These bonds are available in Rs 1,000, Rs 10,000, Rs 1 lakh, Rs 10 lakh, and Rs one crore denominations.To make it possible to use electoral bonds for donations, the Government of India brought amendments to four Acts via the Finance Act of 2016 and 2017. These Acts were the Representation of the People Act of 1951 (RPA), and the Companies Act, of 2013. The Income Tax Act, 1961. And the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA), through the Finance Acts of 2016 and 2017.Though there is no cap on the number of bonds someone can buy, no corporate company can make donations to more than 75 per cent of their total profit or 10 per cent of their total revenue in a single financial year.As per the regulations, the political parties that have secured at least 1 per cent votes in the recent Lok Sabha or State Assembly elections and are registered under the Representation of People’s Act can get a designated account from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to get the donations via electoral bonds. Once received, the political party can encase the amount within 15 days from the day the bonds were bought. In case the party fails to encash the bonds within the timeline, the money will get deposited in the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.The Supreme Court has been hearing the arguments against the Electoral Bond Scheme. The pleas against the scheme have challenged its constitutionality. They have argued that this scheme is a potential threat to democracy in India. The key points in the arguments against the bonds included the violation of the right to information, the possibility of backdoor lobbying and the potential use of shell companies for donations to the political parties. Furthermore, the pleas raised concerns over the anonymity of the bonds and the promotion of corruption by protecting criminals from prosecution.The scheme’s critics have also raised concerns over the name “electoral bonds” as they claimed the money could be used by the political parties for any purpose as there are no specific spending limits. Furthermore, they argued that although the government has reduced the disclosure threshold of the donations, that might not reduce the use of cash in politics. For those who are unaware, those who donate any amount under Rs 20,000 are not obliged to disclose that they have donated to a political party. There have been demands to reduce the threshold further to Rs 2,000 to give more transparency to the political donations by individuals and corporations.One of the arguments that made headlines is the so-called uneven playing field. The critics have argued that since the scheme was launched, around 74 per cent of the donations via electoral bonds went to the ruling party, BJP. The other political parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress and others, received only a small portion of the total amount. They argued that it led to an uneven playing field as the BJP will have more money to spend on political campaigns.Additionally, as the scheme differentiates between corporate donors and individual citizens, the latter might have their voices overpowered by the former in democracy, which could be concerning.Another point that was raised is that the scheme is “unfair” to the donors as the political parties are not bound to disclose where they spent the donations received by electoral bonds. During the arguments, the Supreme Court also raised apprehensions about the possibility of trading of electoral bonds, though it is not allowed.In the end, it was contended that the main aim. However, the government suggested that to reduce the influence of black money was to “redirect non-anonymous funding from traditional banking channels to anonymous Electoral Bonds”, which essentially “created an alternative white money channel”, for the political funding. The critics claimed that these arguments collectively raised significant doubts about the impact of the scheme on political funding, transparency, and the integrity of the electoral process in India.The union government has rejected the arguments against the scheme, stressing that it is designed to bring transparency in funding of political parties. Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta said that there are enough safeguards built into the scheme. He noted that as parties are getting funds through the banking system, it means only clean money is donated to them. He warned that if the scheme is scrapped, it will result in the return to days of funding of parties by cash, which makes preventing black money into the political system impossible.He explained that the scheme has various measures to ensure transparency, such as the requirement for both donors and political parties to have designated accounts and branches. While the identity of the donors is not disclosed, he explained that it is known to the banking system, as there are KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements, which include providing Aadhar numbers and addresses.The solicitor general justified the 1% vote threshold for political parties to receive funds through the bonds, stating that it is intended to prevent the formation of fake parties solely for the purpose of claiming exemptions.Mehta highlighted another safety feature built into the scheme, the validity of only 15 days for the bonds. He asserted that the 15-day limit reduced the potential for quid pro quo deals as donors are required to give the bonds within this period. Moreover, to further minimize the risk, if the bonds are not encashed within the stipulated timeframe of 15 days from the date of issue, the amount goes to the PM Relief Fund, and the donor can’t recover it. While opponents object to the confidentiality of donors in the electoral bond scheme, SG Mehta said that maintaining the secrecy of donors was essential and that the bonds were designed with stringent confidentiality measures. Breaching this confidentiality would leave digital footprints and result in criminal liability for those involved. He said that the investigative agencies could access the details only with a court order.He said no transparent political donation scheme will work if there is no confidentiality. If it is publicly disclosed who donated to which party, it will result in retribution and victimisation of the donor from other political parties. And if therefore the confidentiality clause is removed, the donors will opt to donate through cash instead. SG Mehta said that the Electoral Bonds Scheme had been framed in such a manner that it ensured the confidentiality of the donor entirely until the court ordered otherwise. Only the political party that receives the donation will know the identity of the donors, and others will not know it. The court asked to know about the right of voters to know the donors of the parties, Tushar Mehta said it is not realistic to expect voters to make decisions based on campaign contributions from specific individuals or organizations. Instead, voters base their decisions on factors like ideology, principles, leadership, and the efficiency of a political party, he said. The SG added that businesses may support political parties that create a favourable environment for their operations, but this doesn’t necessarily involve a quid pro quo arrangement where financial contributions lead to political favours. He said, “Purity of election is supreme over the right to vote. Voter votes not based on which party is funded by whom, voter votes based on ideology, principle, leadership, efficiency of the party.” Explaining further why the donor identity needs to be kept confidential, SG Mehta said that there are five crucial considerations in the realm of electoral financing. These considerations include the imperative to reduce the reliance on cash in the electoral process, the promotion of authorized banking channels for campaign contributions, the incentive of confidentiality for donors using these channels, the paramount need for transparency in electoral financing, and the prevention of any form of kickbacks or quid pro quo between those in power and financial benefactors. SG Mehta also invoked the right to privacy, which has been upheld by the apex court, to justify why the donors have the right to keep their identity undisclosed. He referred to the KS Puttaswamy judgment, in which the court had recognized the fundamental right to informational privacy. He emphasized the need to balance the right to know and the right to informational privacy, arguing that the right to informational privacy could be asserted against the general right to know. Mehta said that while the public had a right to know, it should be limited to cases of genuine public interest, and curious or prying inquiries should not infringe upon an individual’s privacy. He pointed out that information about which company had purchased how many bonds and which political party had received how many bonds was already in the public domain. Any additional disclosure beyond this might encourage a return to cash-based political funding, which would not be in the legitimate state’s interest.Adding to the arguments, Attorney General for India R Venkatramani said that there should be specific and direct arguments against the scheme and not broad statements which may resemble a political debate.  Stating that the government was moving from an unregulated system to a regulated system, he added that one cannot say that they would look at each statute in isolation and call them into question. The AG further argued that the scheme doesn’t violate any existing right of any person. While the Supreme Court has reserved its verdict, the court suggested that an alternative system could be devised for political donations to remove the “flaws” in the current system. However, the apex court made it clear that it would not suggest going back to the cash-only system, adding that the deficiencies in the existing system should be addressed.“We do not want to go back to a cash-only system. We are saying do it in a proportionate, tailor-made system which overcomes the serious deficiencies of this electoral bond system,” the Court said. The Court also made it clear that only the legislature or the executive can undertake such an exercise and the Court will not step into that arena.The court said, “You can still devise a system which balances out in a proportional way. How it is to be done is for you to decide. We will not step into that arena, that is not part of our function”. Responding to the five crucial considerations mentioned by SG Mehta, the CJI said, “The balance has to be drawn by the legislature and by the executive; not by us. We are quite conscious of that.”Responding to the arguments by petitioners that the scheme has not stopped black money flowing into parties as cash donations are not banned, CJI said that the validity of the scheme was not necessarily linked to its success in reducing black money and that the main objective was to enhance transparency. He said, “On a constitutional level, this argument will not stand. The fact that they have been unable to or they did not dry all cash sources – is not a ground to challenge the validity of the scheme.”Justice Khanna emphasized that the electoral bond system aimed to ensure money came through regular banking channels with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, which was not the case with cash donations. He also pointed out that the scheme aimed to protect the identity of donors for various reasons.In 2018, the BJP-led government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the Electoral Bond Scheme to promote transparency and legitimacy in political party funding in India. The Ministry of Finance developed this scheme, which uses bearer instruments and strict Know Your Customer (KYC) norms, to create a robust and responsible framework for political contributions.Political parties in India can effectively use funds during elections due to accessible and inclusive political contributions. The electoral bonds’ tax treatment promotes financial transparency, and their integrity is ensured by banning trading. Additionally, the scheme redirects unutilized funds to the Prime Minister Relief Fund, demonstrating responsible financial transactions and reducing the influence of black money in politics. This is a significant step towards strengthening India’s democratic foundation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

52,"2 November, 2023 ","Inside Hamas’ terror den: From building a web of tunnels to depriving civilians of fuel, here is how the terror group is running a sophisticated campaign"," Hamas is maintaining a stockpile of more than 200,000 gallons of fuel for the rockets it fires into Israel and generators that provide clean air and electricity to its terror tunnels.Following the deadly 7th October terror attacks by Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in its response have eliminated several Hamas terrorists, struck terrorist targets and infrastructure, and hit approximately 300 targets including anti-tank missiles posts, rocket launch posts, and terrorist compounds inside underground tunnels.Over the last day, during ground operations:🔻Numerous Hamas terrorists have been eliminated.🔻The IAF struck terrorist targets and infrastructure.🔻IDF combat forces struck approximately 300 targets, including:• Anti-tank missiles posts.• Rocket launch posts.•… pic.twitter.com/RymFDCFrw1Israel’s all-out war on the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas is a resolute retaliation to the 7th October attacks. More than 1,400 people, mostly Israelis, lost their lives and at least 220 were taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza after the brutal terrorist attack. The terrorist group had also launched 5,000 rockets on Israel and its terror attempts continue to this day.Hamas continues to hoard resources to feed itself and its offensive on Israel while left-liberals and Islamists further the terrorist group’s narrative across the world by misusing images and videos of civilian casualties in Gaza to demonise Israel. Amidst all this, innocent civilians, who have historically been used as human shields by Hamas, are paying the price of Hamas’ terrors with their lives.On 24th October, Hamas released two of the 220 Israeli hostages. The two women were identified as Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85. While narrating her ordeal, Lifshitz said that she was beaten, laid on a motorcycle, and carried through the fields towards Gaza. “They brought me to the tunnels; we walked kilometres underground. They beat me in the ribs, even with sticks,” she said.The surprising part of the revelation was when she mentioned that the terrorists seemed prepared for the situation (hostage situation) as they had everything in the tunnels that men and women needed including shampoo. And yet, the two hostages were provided with only meal a day which barely included a cucumber and some cheese. Lifshitz said that she was also provided with medicines.It is shocking, to say the least, that a Palestinian terrorist group – existing with the sole aim of eradicating Jews from the face of the earth – is living and operating in abundance when the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank barely have toilet water to survive. Demanding the release of its hostages, when Israel shut water, electricity and fuel supply to Gaza, the global Islamist ecosystem used the suffering of civilians to demonise Israel instead of holding Hamas accountable.The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Under the rubble on Gaza’s surface exists a web of terrorist tunnels safeguarding Hamas. Referred to as the “Gaza Metro” by the Israeli Defense Forces, the terror tunnels form the biggest part of Hamas’ infrastructure.“Imagine we are looking at the Gaza Strip and really think of the Gaza Strip as one layer for the civilians and another layer for Hamas. We are trying to get to that second layer that Hamas has built,” the IDF spokesperson said.Listen in as an IDF Spokesperson @jconricus provides a situational update on all fronts, as the war against Hamas continues. https://t.co/jSkwACh3iNThese tunnels are used by Hamas to launch rockets in Israel and ensure the safe movement of terrorists across the city. This terror infrastructure right under the civilian infrastructure prompted the Israeli forces to ask civilians to evacuate areas where it was scheduled to conduct strikes.A compilation of videos published by IDF on YouTube shows how the terrorists use the tunnels to smuggle, transport, and store ammunition. According to the IDF, some of these tunnels span under the border of Israel. In fact, Hamas has openly admitted that the tunnels built inside Gaza are for the protection of its terrorists and not for civilians. This proud admission by the terrorist group was in response to a question that why Hamas wasn’t building bomb shelters within Gaza to save the residents from Israeli bombings.Hamas terrorist Mousa Abu Marzouk said that it was the responsibility of the UN and Israel to protect civilians living in Gaza. “We have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed. These tunnels are meant to protect us from aeroplanes. We are fighting from inside the tunnels,” the terrorist said.Amid the ground operations, Israel is now targeting the roughly 300-mile (500 km) tunnel network under Gaza believed to run deeper than 200 feet.The Israeli forces are specifically targeting areas where a cluster of Hamas infrastructure is centred. Under Gaza’s largest hospital Al Shifa, lies the headquarter of Hamas. A video released by the IDF shows a compound that Hamas has built under the Al Shifa hospital which includes storage facilities for weapons, command and control facilities, offices and places for terrorists to hide in.Operational Update with an IDF Spokesperson, @jconricus https://t.co/3rYeT2Nc2e“This puts the people that are being treated in the hospital at risk. It should be condemned, it should be stopped,” Conricus said. The hospital’s neonatal unit sustained damages following the initial strikes by Israel targeting “Jihadi” infrastructure which surrounds the very hospital.The Shifa Hospital is not only the largest hospital in Gaza but it also acts as the main headquarters for Hamas’ terrorist activity. Terrorism does not belong in a hospital and the IDF will operate to uncover any terrorist infrastructure. pic.twitter.com/Ybpln5xQb2Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, has taken refuge under the Al-Shifa Hospital and is using the patients at the hospital as a shield to protect himself. The Hamas terrorist had once mercilessly killed a person with a sink while he was in prison on the suspicion of collaborating with Israel.The Washington Post in 2014 reported that Al Shifa Hopital had become the “de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders who can be seen in the hallways and offices”. In 2014, when Israel and Palestine agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt, a protester from a mosque opposite to the Al Shifa hospital blared on a loudspeaker calling the then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his administration “traitors” and “collaborators”.Crowds had gathered at the hospital in July 2014 throwing shoes and eggs at the health minister who was turned away before he reached the hospital. The Al Shifa hospital is just one among the several civilian structures that have regularly been used by Hamas to launch attacks at Israel.According to a report by Tablet dated 2014, one of Hamas’ main command bunkers was located beneath Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The bunker was equipped with sophisticated communications equipment and housed a part of the Hamas leadership.The report claimed that in 2006, PBS aired a documentary showing how gunmen roamed the halls of the Al Shifa Hospital, intimidated the staff, and denied them access to protected locations within the building where the camera crew was prohibited from filming.Mosques and UN facilities in close proximity to civilian infrastructure are also being used by Hamas to launch attacks. “Hamas terrorists operate inside and under civilian buildings, precisely because they know the IDF distinguishes between terrorists and civilians,” RAdm. Daniel Hagari of the IDF said on 29th October.Beneath the hospitals, schools, mosques, and homes in Gaza lies a horrific underworld of Hamas terrorism. In order to dismantle Hamas, we must dismantle their underground tunnels. pic.twitter.com/pHBUPUqzQRA bunch of images shared by the Israel Defense Forces on X, formerly Twitter, on 22nd October, showed that a Hamas rocket launch site is located right opposite the UN building in Gaza, another such terror launchpad is located exactly opposite a mosque.A third image shows a Hamas rocket launchpad dangerously close to neighbouring schools in the area.It is with the help of such launchpads that Hamas is still being able to launch rockets at Israel, 24 days after the deadly 7th October terrorist attacks.In a video shared by the Israel War Room on X, a Hamas terrorist can be seen dressed in civilian clothes and launching a rocket at Israel. “He disguises himself as a civilian, while engaged in military activity, so that later they can claim that Israel is harming civilians,” a tweet by Israel War Room reads.The military wing of Hamas publishes documentation of large mortars being fired at Israel.Pay attention to an interesting detail: the operative of the military wing of Hamas is dressed in civilian clothes. He disguises himself as a civilian, while engaged in military activity,… pic.twitter.com/5qRMePlhlsIn a video recently shared by Hamas, terrorists can be seen dressed in civilian clothes emerging out of a terror tunnel armed with rockets to attack an Israeli tank. Another video published by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a terrorist group committed to the eradication of Israel and Jews, shows terrorists in civilian clothes launching rockets and chanting “Allah Hu Akbar”. “Just because mainstream media reports civilian deaths in Gaza doesn’t mean they are all really civilians,” the Israel War Room tweeted on X.In this video published today by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), rocket-launching terrorists are dressed in civilian clothing.Just because mainstream media reports civilian deaths in Gaza doesn't mean they're all really civilians. pic.twitter.com/wSjFBKsv1WCoinciding with this, there was the recent incident wherein during a live broadcast on CNN, a supposed corpse of a civilian in Gaza was seen moving its head. The viral video on X was shared by Israel War Room with the caption, “Pallywood is racist and based on absolutely NO facts or truth, except for the occasional dead body moving its head while a Palestinian woman wails and screams for the camera.”“Pallywood is racist and based on absolutely NO facts or truth,” except for the occasional dead body moving its head while a Palestinian woman wails and screams for the camera. https://t.co/HMIcU6N0nX pic.twitter.com/xdaEzrbWoMGlobal media is rife with news reports of fuel and electricity shortages in hospitals in Gaza. However, according to IDF, Hamas has stored 500,000 litres of fuel that they refuse to provide to the people of Gaza. In a testimony, a Hamas terrorist captured by Israeli forces can be heard saying that the Hamas fill tanks full of fuel for themselves.The IDF has also alleged that Hamas is also stealing fuel including 50,000 litres from a private vendor in northern Gaza and 24,000 litres of fuel from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).When you hear that people in Gaza don't have fuel, it's because Hamas took all of it. pic.twitter.com/i2MOjesZxwA call between an IDF officer and a senior Gazan Energy official has revealed that Hamas has at least a million litres of fuel, and gas stations are full of fuel. “Underground, I am sure they have at least half a million litres. As you know, they need oxygen in the tunnels, and they need phones, and they need showers and lighting there,” the Gazan Energy official said.Hamas’ terrorist headquarters under the Shifa hospital is draining the necessities—fuel, oxygen, water and electricity—from the Gazans and staff and using them for terrorism. pic.twitter.com/LKCu0WILvdIn a tweet on 24th October, the UNRWA said that if it does not get fuel urgently, it will be forced to halt operations in the Gaza Strip. In response to the same, the IDF shared an image of huge fuel reserves with Hamas and captioned it, “These fuel tanks are inside Gaza. They contain more than 500,000 litres of fuel. Ask Hamas if you can have some.”The IDF has released another recording of a conversation between a Hamas terrorist and a Gazan citizen exposing how Hamas takes fuel from hospitals in the region. In the conversation, a Gazan citizen can be heard pleading for fuel in the course of the talk which reveals how Hamas has been stealing fuel from hospitals.Listen for yourselves: pic.twitter.com/iABBnFe1PQA report by NBC claims that the terrorist group is maintaining a stockpile of more than 200,000 gallons of fuel for the rockets it fires into Israel and generators that provide clean air and electricity to its terror tunnels. Safe to say that Hamas is denying the ample amount of fuel it has in store to the Gaza civilians in order to be able to sponsor its terrorist ativities against Israel.In the 7th October attacks, Hamas was equipped with a barrage of rockets, paragliding equipment, machine guns, convoys, RPGs, and anti-tank missiles to name a few. According to the Alma Research and Education Centre, one of Israel’s weak points exploited by Hamas was the reluctance to deploy ground manoeuvring forces. What the world witnessed in the 7th October attacks was Hamas launching an attack on Israel from all fronts and “precise armament for the manoeuvring move into the invaded territory”.“Such assistance can be in the form of a preliminary fire for the maneuver or through the activation of fire at the same time as the maneuver. Such activation requires a high level of coordination in the intelligence-attack combination due to the high dynamism of the maneuvering move. It seems that Hamas, in the current attack operation, has implemented this new concept,” the report says.Notably, many of Hamas’ operations are inspired by Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group also infamous for its anti-Israel activities. Both Hamas and Hezbollah established dedicated forces (the Radwan force in Hezbollah and the Nukhba force in Hamas) to launch rockets into Israeli territory on a large scale. Like within Gaza, terror tunnels were dug on the border with Lebanon and on the border with the Gaza Strip, which, as established before, are used for infiltration of terrorists into Israeli territory.Founded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in 1982, the Hezbollah have historically backed Hamas in its war against Israel. Shortly after the 7th October attacks by Hamas, Israel’s northern front came under firing and attack from Hezbollah although the situation was relatively contained. The IDF has said that Hezbollah is continuing its attack across the northern border.“They have fired rockets, they have tried to infiltrate, they have fired dozens of anti-tank missiles at our civilians and at our military positions. They have fired rockets at our positions in Mount Dov and at our communities,” IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said. In retaliation, Israel has targeted Hezbollah infrastructure including weapons, posts and sites in Lebanon.Operational Update with an IDF Spokesperson, @jconricus https://t.co/3rYeT2Nc2eMoreover, a research report from 2021 exposed the scope of Hamas’ military activities in Lebanon with the objective to create an additional front against Israel. As per Alma Research and Education Centre, the terrorist group has a “Construction Bureau” based in Lebanon and Turkey, which shapes Hamas’s forces in all areas that it operates in including Gaza, West Bank, and Lebanon.This Bureau of Hamas comprises “specialised departments, each responsible for different sets of activities, such as weapons manufacturing, military intelligence, combat training, communications, funding, planning, logistics, security, and foreign relations”. Moreover, Hamas’ two operational units in Lebanon – El Shimali and Khaled Ali develop and produce their own weapons including rockets, offensive drones, and small unmanned underwater vehicles. They also set up operational cells while preparing attack plans against Israel.Between May and August 2021, there were five incidents of Grad rockets from Lebanon against Israel, reports suspect that Hamas was behind the attacks. According to a report by Alma Research and Education Centre, Iran’s terror capital is in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is armed with over 200,000 warheads including 70,000 rockets, 145,000 mortars, and precision-guided missiles, and thousands of terrorists trained to invade into Israel and execute a similar attack like Hamas’ attack on 7th October.The scale of the terrorist attacks earlier this month and the specialised arms, logistics, and communication operations to back such attacks prove that unabated terrorism can legitimise its existence which is direct threat to Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,"1 November, 2023 ","Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan, Samantha Power, George Soros, the ‘democracy in danger’ and ‘genocide’ cries: A potential regime change op?"," Power's meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.Rahul Gandhi’s mysterious visit to Uzbekistan has created a buzz in India. Why Uzbekistan? Why now, especially when the assembly elections fever is at its peak? We do not have the answers. However, now that the Central Asian country is in the spotlight, let me share about someone else who was in Uzbekistan on official business. Samantha Power, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), was there on October 23-24 to preside over the C5+1 Regional Connectivity Ministerial.Samantha Power has an impressive resume – a war correspondent for several publications including The Economist, an author, a government official and a diplomat. Her notable work, A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2003. In that book, Power meticulously chronicled a century’s worth of American inaction in the face of massacres. The book inspired the ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine, emphasising that the United States and other nations bear a moral obligation to safeguard persecuted or threatened populations worldwide.Samantha Power boasts a significant history of association with Barack Obama, dating back to his days as a senator. Her journey alongside him began as a foreign policy fellow in 2005-06 in his senatorial office. She further played a pivotal role as a foreign policy adviser during his 2008 presidential campaign. However, she encountered controversy during this time when she referred to Hillary Clinton as ‘a monster’ during an interview, which she thought was an off-record comment, leading to her resignation from the campaign.In late November 2008, as the Obama administration took shape, Power was in the State Department transition team. She was appointed the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights on the National Security Council, serving from January 2009 to February 2013. She spearheaded the creation of a White House task force called the Atrocities Prevention Board – an interagency body to focus on emerging human rights crises before they escalated to the level of genocide. She was its inaugural chairperson. Power’s long-standing association with Obama underscores her involvement in shaping the US foreign policy of the Obama era. She is considered a key figure in persuading President Obama to militarily intervene in Libya; something that Obama considers as the worst decision of his Presidency. Thanks to her unwavering belief in the United States’ responsibility to prevent or alleviate the suffering of civilians in foreign nations, she earned nicknames such as the Ivy League Joan of Arc and Activist-in-Chief.According to The New Yorker, “When she entered the White House, at the age of thirty-eight, she had already established a reputation as a kind of Joan of Arc for humanitarian intervention.” The same article also mentions that while Obama welcomed her advocacy, she used to get on his nerves and that during a meeting to discuss Syria, Obama snapped, “We’ve all read your book, Samantha.” In February 2013, she left the National Security Council. In June of that year, Obama appointed her as the US Ambassador to the United Nations. In a 2014 article, The New Yorker stated that unlike Vice President Joe Biden, and others who had risen through the foreign-policy establishment, Power favoured aligning the United States with citizen-led movements.Power was on TIME’s influential 100 list in 2015 (also in 2004), where she was referred to as the ‘new conscience of the US foreign policy establishment’ by Madeline Albright in a tribute titled Enemy of despots. She has been a big advocate of greater interference in the internal affairs of other nations, even military interventions, to defend humanitarianism. Given her openness to military interventions in Libya, Syria and Yemen, she has been often criticised for wanting to solve ‘problems from hell’ by using ‘solutions from hell’. In December 2014, she told The New Yorker, “As time wears on, I find myself gravitating more and more to the GSD people… (‘get shit done’, a term favoured by Susan Rice). Principles and positions only take you so far.”In January 2021, Joe Biden nominated Power to head the USAID.Power’s husband, Cass Robert Sunstein, is a professor and author and was also a part of the Obama administration. His views on ‘Mission LiFE’ were featured by Niti Aayog as well as included in the collection of views published by the Press Information Bureau.Power’s meetings with the Open Society Foundation and other left-leaning organisations during her role with USAID have raised eyebrows among the Republicans, but let us say that was a part of her job, and focus on some other interesting facts.In a March 2011 article on Samantha Power in The New York Times, Kenneth Roth, the then-Executive Director of Human Rights Watch called her “the foremost voice for human rights within the White House, and she has Obama’s ear.” The views of Roth or HRW on India are well, not so great.A more intriguing aspect of Power’s life is her perceived proximity to Henry Kissinger, known for his strong stance against India, as well as with the much-discussed George Soros. Both Kissinger and Soros were present at an exclusive gathering in SoHo on 31 May 2016, to celebrate the publication of a book by Cass Sunstein. A week later, on 8 June, Power received the 2016 Henry A. Kissinger Prize from the man himself. Interestingly, Power had strongly criticised Kissinger’s bloody, anti-human rights record in two of her books, including the Pulitzer Prize winner.Three years before that, in November 2013, when Soros received the top honour at the International Rescue Committee Benefit, Bill Clinton and Samantha Power both lauded him. Samantha Power on Soros: “My first introduction to George was indirect. I met (the late humanitarian) Fred Cuny and heard him describe how he and his patron George Soros were going to single-handedly break the siege of Sarajevo. Humble guys, I thought, modest in ambition. Little did I know.”Six years after that award night, in November 2019, Power tweeted this in response to Hungary kicking out Soros’ Central European University.In a September 2019 interview featured in The Guardian, Samantha Power’s new memoir, The Education of an Idealist, is described as having a broader aim: a call to action during a time of despair, as Donald Trump lays siege to what is left of the liberal order at home and abroad. She expressed her desire for readers to get a renewed sense of agency after reading her book and feel empowered to address the pressing problems around them. She also shared her plan to campaign for the Democratic cause in swing states.Power was in India from 25-27 July 2022. On the 26th, she met with civil society representatives to discuss freedom of expression, speech, identity, and the importance of protecting the rights of minority groups and underscored the continued commitment of the US to work with civil society organisations to advance human rights and fundamental freedoms. Then, on the 27th, addressing an event at IIT Delhi, Power said: “The headwinds against democratic rule are strong the world over. Within the United States and India, there are forces who seek to sow division, who seek to pit ethnicities and religions against one another, who wish to bend laws, abuse institutions and wield violence against those who stand in their way; we saw this, of course, on January 6 in the United States last year…” “But ultimately, what has positioned India as a future development leader has not been its assets but its values… It has been India’s multi-ethnic, multi-party democracy that has allowed it to withstand the challenges… It has been its support for free expression over decades that has allowed injustices to come to light. It has been its tolerance for diversity and dissent that has allowed reforms to take hold and institutions to progress. India’s trajectory has been so strong because – not in spite of – its democracy.”The Telegraph editorial on the 29th read: “While referencing Nehru and M.K. Gandhi, she (Power) did not mention Mr Modi even once. This was no oversight. Instead, it was a nudge to India to clear the shadow hovering over its commitment to its historical values. But a friend can only hold up a mirror. It is New Delhi that needs to look within.”On the 27th, Samantha Power also granted an interview to the NDTV’s Maha Siddiqui. Towards the interview’s conclusion, Siddiqui cited Power’s journalistic background to inquire about her perspective on the declining state of press freedom in India, even referencing a case involving a ‘fact checker.’ While Power refrained from explicit criticism, she expressed her viewpoint in a rather verbose manner by highlighting that India’s strength is rooted in healthy debate and criticism and emphasising that President Biden staunchly supports the cause of press freedom.Rewind to November 2010. During his visit to India, President Obama visited the first-ever Expo on Democracy and Open Government on the 7th in Mumbai. The event also marked the launch of the United States-India Open Government Dialogue, aimed at promoting government transparency and greater citizen engagement. It was led by the United States Chief Technology Officer, Aneesh Chopra, and the Adviser to the Prime Minister of India, Sam Pitroda.Incidentally, Chopra considers Pitroda, his father’s peer, as his inspiration. In November 2020, Chopra was named a member of one of the Joe Biden Presidential Transition Agency Review Teams to support transition efforts. Apart from Pitroda and Chopra, other Americans present for the event were Tom Vilsack (Agriculture Secretary, then and now), Samantha Power and Rajiv Shah (then Administrator USAID, now President of the Rockefeller group). At the end of the expo, Samantha Power read out a statement that ended with, “…we announced at today’s expo an initial commitment of approximately $1m to support the work of Indian civil society in sharing their best practices abroad, with a matching commitment of in-kind assistance by Sam Pitroda that will harness India’s technical expertise to assist governments in harnessing technology, improving services, and enhancing democratic accountability. This is precisely the kind of “partnership built on shared values” that President Obama has hailed during his visit to India.” Sunita Vishwanath (Hindus for Human Rights) was a panellist in the ‘India on the Brink: Preventing Genocide’ conference, a three-day virtual event organised from 26-28 February 2022 to ‘condemn looming genocide of Indian Muslims’. The participants’ list was big, and the conference was duly covered by The Wire. On a side note, Vishwanath was awarded a ‘Champions of Change’ award in July 2015, by the Obama Administration.There has been a consistent rise in the media article titles that talk about India being on the brink.Not to mention, the Gandhi dynasty scion, who never misses an opportunity to talk about erosion or collapse of Indian democracy when abroad.India ranks 8th among the countries that are at the highest risk for mass killing in a ranking given by the America-based Early Warning Project (EWP). The EWP has consistently assessed India as high risk since 2017–18, including second rank in 2021-22. Imagine the world’s largest democracy is assessed to have a higher chance of mass killings than Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Zimbabwe, … EWP, by the way, uses the V-Dem dataset, and V-dem is funded by Soros. (Damn!)Now, amidst the democracy in danger and genocide cries, consider these:In the lead-up to India’s 2024 general election, the spectre of foreign interference is undeniable. India’s pivotal role in the United States’ Indo-Pacific strategy is well-established. However, it becomes complicated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolute stand in safeguarding Indian strategic interests and his refusal to succumb to Western pressure. The United States would rather support a candidate who has expressed implicit or explicit openness to Western intervention. There is a realisation that Modi and the BJP are going to win, but that will not deter external players from attempting to weaken Modi, even if there is no chance of defeating him. Against this backdrop, the timing of Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Uzbekistan coinciding with Samantha Power’s visit raises intriguing questions. Is it a mere coincidence, or is it a ‘power’ful signal of what may be on the horizon?This article was first published on the author’s blog and has been reproduced here with the author’s permission.

He added that he only expects the indigenous Assamese Muslims to vote for him. It is worth noting here that Miyas are Bengali-speaking migrant Muslims who settled in Assam coming from present-day Bangladesh.During a media interaction in Guwahati CM Sarma said, “I don’t expect votes from Miya Muslims. I don’t visit medical colleges because Miya Muslims are there in more numbers.”CM Sarma reportedly added that his government is primarily focused on the development and welfare of the indigenous Muslims of Assam. “I never expect votes from Muslims, except the indigenous Muslims from Assam. It is very sad that Miya Muslims are more than our indigenous youth in every medical college. I have stopped going much to these colleges now,” the Assam CM said.The Assam Chief Minister further said that the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had a “vote relationship” with the Miya Muslim community in Assam and that votes have been obtained from them over the years by fostering an “atmosphere of fear.”“Both parties have a relationship with Muslims of migrant origin until they get votes, but they have not taken any steps for their development or in the areas where they live,” Sarma reportedly said, adding that no roads, bridges, schools, or colleges have been built for them.FLASH: Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday said he does not expect votes from 'Miya Muslims'. Addressing the media in Guwahati, Himanta Sarma further stated that his primary focus is on the well-being and progress of the indigenous Muslim population in Assam.… pic.twitter.com/pAWqg9aI30“As a first step, we have taken measures to improve the living conditions of the indigenous Assamese Muslims and a survey will be conducted soon on them,” continued.However, despite not expecting electoral support from the Miya Muslims, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma clarified that his government is dedicated to providing various government schemes to benefit all residents, including the Miya Muslim community.He said that Miya Muslims have the best days under the BJP government, as the govt undertakes all development activities for them without expecting to get votes. The CM added that if Congress or AIUDF does something for them, they will count how many votes they got in which booth in the area.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma made the comments replying to a question in a press conference he had held to give updates on several major infrastructure projects in the state, including tunnel under Brahmaputra, Kaziranga National Park elevated road and Guwahati ting road.On the other hand, AIUDF chief Maulana Badruddin Ajmal and Dhubri MP while responding to CM Sarma’s comments said that not having Miya Muslims to work would culminate in a deserted Guwahati. “If Miya Muslims do not work for three days in Guwahati, it will turn into a graveyard,” Ajmal said.Notably, Badruddin Ajmal had recently sparked controversy after saying that Muslims are “number 1” when comes to crimes like robbery, rape, murder, eve teasing and also on top in going to jail. He also said that while others are reaching the moon, Muslims are doing PhD on how to go to jail.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

According to the party functionary, they have been expelled for contesting the upcoming state assembly elections against the party’s official candidates. According to a release issued by the party’s state vice-president Rajiv Singh, these 39 leaders were expelled from the Congress on the directives of the party’ state unit chief Kamal Nath.The release added that these expelled leaders are contesting elections either as independent candidates or on the ticket of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).A few of the prominent names expelled from the Congress party’s primary membership include former MP Premchand Guddu (Alot), former MLA Antar Singh Darbar (Mhow), former MLA Yadvendra Singh (Nagod), state party spokesman Ajay Singh Yadav (Khargapur), Nasir Islam (Bhopal North) and Amir Aqueel (Bhopal North).The development comes at a time when Congress is at loggerheads with one of its major alliance partners in the I.N.D.I. bloc. The discord which has only worsened with each passing day erupted after disputes arose over the seat-sharing formula in the poll-bound state.

He remarked that the fact that Congress is now requesting a caste census is a ‘miracle.’ The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister emphasised that the grand old party has come to the realisation that voters in backward areas do not support them.Apart from verbal exchanges and jibes, SP also fielded its candidates on 31 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh adding woes to its “alliance” partner Congress. Voting in Madhya Pradesh will take place a fortnight later on 17th November for the 230-seat Madhya Pradesh assembly while the result will be announced on 3rd December. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

It is being reported in the media that the connections of this money are linked to Chhattisgarh.”Criticising Chhattisgarh’s chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on the issue of corruption, he said, “The government and the Chief Minister of the state should tell the people of Chhattisgarh what is their relationship with the accused of this scam who is sitting in Dubai. After all, why is the Chief Minister of the state irritated after this money is caught?”Lamenting the Congress government on other alleged corruption scandals, PM Narendra Modi said, “The poor people of Chhattisgarh have been looted, and strict action will be taken against those who did this. The corrupt government of Chhattisgarh has broken your trust by committing one scam after another. The PSC and Mahadev app scam is in the discussion, but there is no shortage of scams in the report card of the Congress government.”Enlisting other scams, he added, “Rs 2,000 crore liquor scam, Rs 500 crore cement scam, Rs 5,000 crore rice scam, Rs 1,300 crore Gauthan (grazing land for cows) scam, Rs 700 crore DMF scam.

61,"4 November, 2023 ","Amidst squabbling between I.N.D.I. Alliance parties, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge says projecting PM candidate will break alliance unity"," It is preferable, according to him, to be contest elections without a common PM candidate so that parties can convene and choose a candidate. He stressed, ""This will ensure all are together in the run-up to the general election."" The Congress is opposed to portraying any member of the I.N.D.I. Alliance as a prime ministerial candidate to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, according to Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge in an exclusive interview with NDTV. It is preferable, according to him, to be contest elections without a common PM candidate so that parties can convene and choose a candidate. He stressed, “This will ensure all are together in the run-up to the general election.” So evidently, Kharge admitted that even as the 2024 elections are just months away, there is no consensus among the I.N.D.I.Alliance partners regarding a PM candidate and there is a risk of the coalition breaking apart over the issue. The Congress has revealed that it is in communication with all of its partners in the coalition, including Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of Bihar to clarify that the party needed to take a break from the opposition meetings because the state elections are also important to it. He alleged that confronting the Bharatiya Janata Party required forging an alliance and cooperating as a unit. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recently accused Congress of ignoring the opposition bloc in a CPI (Communist Party of India) rally. The Congress party, he emphasised, is not paying attention to the alliance because it is too consumed with preparing for the assembly polls that are coming up in five states. The Bihar CM added, “We have been speaking to them, pushing them forward in I.N.D.I. Alliance. But, of late, there has not been much progress on that front. The Congress seems to be more interested in the five assembly polls.”Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge also pointed out that his party’s state divisions oppose any cooperation with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He added that despite the fact that the Congress and the Left parties are fierce rivals in Kerala, the AAP ought to consider supporting and fighting alongside the coalition in a manner similar to what the Left parties are doing across the country.It is evident from his unambiguous stance against endorsing a prime ministerial candidate that Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi is not a serious contender for the prime ministerial position. NDTV quoted anonymous party sources to add that the Gandhi scion does not particularly want to be considered for the post.All is not well in the Congress-led coalition as regular infighting and tussle are witnessed between the alliance partners. Congress is continuously under fire from Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav. He recently slammed them for promising him six seats in the upcoming Madhya Pradesh assembly election but failing to give even one seat to his party. He charged that even after this arrangement was agreed upon, Congress fielded candidates for every seat and left no space for the Samajwadi Party.Yadav then took a jab at his coalition partner for demanding a nationwide caste census and contended that it was being done for political reasons. He remarked that the fact that Congress is now requesting a caste census is a ‘miracle.’ The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister emphasised that the grand old party has come to the realisation that voters in backward areas do not support them.

In a letter addressed to Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge, he expressed his discontent with the allocation of Congress tickets in the Alwar district. The assembly elections in Rajasthan are scheduled to be held on 25 November. Karan Singh Yadav’s resignation from the party comes as a big blow to the Congress organisation facing the challenge of defending the Ashok Gehlot government.Karan Singh Yadav urged for a reassessment of the party candidates declared for the Kathumar and Rajgarh-Laxmangarh, as well as Behror seats. He further cautioned that if these changes are not implemented, his letter should be considered as his resignation from Congress and that this resignation should be accepted.On Friday, Karan Singh Yadav and his supporters also held a massive protest outside Congress leader Sonia Gandhi’s residence over ticket distribution for Rajasthan assembly elections. At this time, his supporters raised slogans against Congress leader Bhanwar Jitendra Singh who is considered a close aide of Rahul Gandhi. #WATCH | Delhi: Former Congress MP Karan Singh Yadav and his supporters hold a protest outside Congress leader Sonia Gandhi's residence over ticket distribution for Rajasthan assembly elections pic.twitter.com/NMjW1JwlgvFormer Member of Parliament Karan Singh Yadav is currently in disagreement with the Congress party’s decision to nominate Sanjay Yadav from Behror, Mangelal Meena from Rajgarh-Laxmangarh, and Sanjana Yadav from Kathua constituency. He emphasised that Johrilal Meena from Rajgarh-Laxmangarh and Babulal Bairwa from Kathua have previously served as three-time MLAs, and it is not appropriate to deny tickets to such experienced leaders. Yadav is advocating for the Congress ticket to be given to long-standing activist Advocate Bastiram Yadav from Behror. Additionally, Yadav stated his intention to meet the party’s organisational General Secretary, KC Venugopal, on Saturday.The dissatisfaction among Congress leaders regarding the allocation of tickets appears to be ongoing. In addition to Yadav, several former MLAs have publicly voiced their discontent with the ticket distribution and have declared their intentions to contest the elections if the tickets are not reconsidered. Johrilal Meena, an MLA representing the Rajgarh-Laxmangarh assembly constituency, has submitted his nomination as an Independent candidate, despite being denied a ticket by the party.A coordination committee was established by the Alwar district Congress president to handle ticket distribution row within the Congress party. The committee had the task of meeting with disgruntled leaders and managing the situation. However, even after two days had passed, the committee did not achieve significant success in this endeavour.

66,"5 November, 2023 ",War in the Middle East is taking away the focus: Zelensky laments how Israel-Hamas war is overshadowing Russia-Ukraine war," Volodymyr Zelensky said, ""We have already been in tough situations when there was almost no focus on Ukraine.""On Saturday (4th November), Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky lamented that the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas somehow took the focus from the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been going on since February 2022. He made this statement in a press conference with EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen on her tour to Ukraine to assess the war-torn country’s preparations to join the European Union.Volodymyr Zelensky said, “Of course, it’s clear that the war in the Middle East, this conflict, is taking away the focus. We have already been in tough situations when there was almost no focus on Ukraine. I am sure we will overcome this challenge.”We will continue to support and promote a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.Our support is unshakable. https://t.co/UFLeaqCToRZelensky was also prompted to provide a response regarding the recent evaluation from Ukraine’s top military commander, Valery Zaluzhny, who stated that the conflict was transitioning into a phase of static positioning. This shift was seen as advantageous for Moscow, as it could facilitate the reconstruction of its military capabilities.In response to this, Volodymyr Zelensky said, “Today, the time has passed and people are tired and there are different opinions. But this is not a stalemate.” He acknowledged that Russia had gained aerial control and emphasised the pressing need for US-manufactured F-16 fighter jets and sophisticated anti-aircraft defences to alter the current state of affairs.Notably, Zelensky’s recent remarks came during a period when the United States House of Representatives passed a Republican-sponsored bill granting $14.3 billion in aid to Israel on Thursday (2nd November). This move contradicted the request made by US President Joe Biden to allocate supplementary funds for Ukraine and other pressing issues. Ukrainian forces are already contending with fatigue and uncertainties surrounding the future of US military aid.The Ukrainian leader also dismissed the notion that Western nations were pressuring Kyiv to engage in negotiations with Russia. He said, “Today, no one among EU, US leaders and others – our partners – is putting pressure on us to now sit down to negotiate with Russia and give away something to it. This will not happen.”Good to be back in Kyiv for my 6th war time visit.I’m here to discuss Ukraine’s accession path to the EU.The EU’s financial support to rebuild Ukraine as a modern, prosperous democracy.And how we will continue to make Russia pay for its war of aggression. pic.twitter.com/dLJ6bUz4UUEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen landed in Kyiv on Saturday ahead of the imminent presentation of a European Union report next week, which assesses Ukraine’s advancements in its quest for EU membership. She posted from her X handle, “Good to be back in Kyiv for my 6th wartime visit. I’m here to discuss Ukraine’s accession path to the EU. The EU’s financial support to rebuild Ukraine as a modern, prosperous democracy. And how we will continue to make Russia pay for its war of aggression.”Ukraine and Russia have been at war for more than a year now. In 2014, Russia captured Crimea from Ukraine and has been controlling it ever since. The war started after Russia felt provoked by Ukraine’s inclination to join NATO which is largely an anti-Russia coalition of Western nations. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and the battle is being fought on Ukrainian soil. Ukraine has received immense support from the West but the support is gradually fading. Ukraine has seen massive losses in men and territory.Israel’s all-out war on the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas is a resolute retaliation to the 7th October attacks. More than 1,400 people, mostly Israelis, lost their lives and at least 220 were taken hostage by Hamas in Gaza after the brutal terrorist attack. The terrorist group had also launched 5,000 rockets on Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Qureshi also claimed that it would get difficult for Hindus once their [Muslims] government is formed at the centre. After the video sparked controversy on social media, Ghaziabad Police took cognisance of the matter and detained Ayaan Qureshi for questioning.In a statement, ASP Naresh Kumar said, “A video has been brought to our notice of Ayaan Qureshi, who lives in Masoori, Ghaziabad. He used derogatory language against a specific religion. An FIR is being registered against the accused. Qureshi was detained and questioned. Further investigation is underway.”सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल वीडियो जिसमें अयान कुरैशी द्वारा धर्म विशेष के खिलाफ आपत्तिजनक टिप्पणी की जा रही है, जिसका तत्काल संज्ञान लेकर आरोपी के खिलाफ अभियोग पंजीकृत किया जा रहा है एवं आरोपी की हिरासत में लेकर पूछताछ की जा रही है । अग्रिम विधिक कार्यवाही प्रचलित है~एसीपी मसूरी। pic.twitter.com/b6FnwLuMZ0Qureshi, who lives in Rafiqabad, which is a  small locality in Ghaziabad, said he runs a meat shop. Using derogatory language about Hindus, he said, “You keep saying Hindu-Hindu, tell me where are Hindus. The real fight is between Jews and Muslims. What are Hindus? They will get crushed like insects when the time comes.” It appeared he was referring to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.He continued, “You can change the names of the places like Prayagraj and keep doing that. However, when our government comes, it will all be reversed.” He added, “Inshallah Islam zinda tha zinda hi rahega (Islam is thriving, and it will remain forever).”Qureshi did not stop there. He accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of Hindu appeasement and working against Muslims. He added, “When our government comes, they [CM Yogi and other Hindu leaders] will be thrown in jails.” Qureshi claimed there has been no development in the past nine years since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power at the centre.Qureshi lashed out at the government for shutting meat shops during Hindu festivals. He claimed that for six months, his shop remained closed due to Hindu festivals. He said, “Why do you shut meat shops in Muslim areas? We don’t ask to shut liquor shops during Ramzan. You should let meat shops run in Muslim areas uninterrupted. If you want to close them, do it in Hindu-dominating areas.” He further claimed Hindus and Muslims who run the abattoirs are unnecessarily named in it.Qureshi, who finds Congress leader Rahul Gandhi a promising candidate for the position of Prime Minister, sparked controversy specifically because of his Hinduphobic language. Netizens called for strict action against him.X (formerly Twitter) user Chandan Mishra said, “This is Ayaan Qureshi from Rafiqabad, Masoori in Ghaziabad. See what he is saying openly.

69,"3 November, 2023 ","Hamas accused of killing women and children for moving to southern Gaza, videos showing bodies with gunshot injuries on a Gaza street appear"," While the video was shared claiming that Israeli airstrike killed the civilians, there was no sign of any airstrike, and victims were gunshot injuriesAs Israel continues its ground operations in Gaza in an attempt to eliminate Hamas terrorists and rescue hostages, the terror group has been accused of killing innocent Palestinian civilians including women and children. Social media accounts are claiming that Hamas snipers killed dozens of women and children on the street when they were trying to move out of northern Gaza.It is notable that Israel has been repeatedly asking civilians in north Gaza and Gaza City to move to south Gaza, but Hamas is preventing them from doing so. It has been alleged Hamas wants civilians to stay to use them as human shields in the war against Israel.British-Arab Influencer Amjad Taha tweeted on X claiming that the civilians were displaying white flags as a sign of peace, but they were targeted by Hamas shooters.Breaking News: Just now, #Hamas snipers have reportedly killed dozens of children and women on the streets, targeting those attempting to travel from north to south #Gaza and those displaying white flags as a sign of peace. Similar acts have previously been attributed to…He added, “Similar acts have previously been attributed to Palestinian and Hezbollah terrorists in Syria. They do not want civilians to leave; they want to use them as human shields and kill anyone who attempts to leave. Hamas terrorists in Gaza will, as usual, blame Israel because it is easy and there is media that accepts this propaganda.”In fact, Hamas supporters have posted visuals of bodies of women and children lying on a street, blaming Israeli airstrikes. An Arabic tweet by a social media influencer said, ‘Horrific scenes now on Al-Rashid Street, west of Gaza, after the occupation bombed the displaced people in the middle of the street!’محتوى حساس تحذيرمشاهد مروعة الآن على شارع الرشيد غرب غزة بعد قصف الاحتلال للنازحين في وسط الشارع !المصور يبكي ويقول امانه يارب احمي شعبنا 😭😭حتى النازحين الصهاينة قتلوهم ☹️😒 pic.twitter.com/3ONDz9gWFFHowever, netizens were quick to spot that the video does not indicate airstrike, and the victims were most likely shot. They pointed out that there is no crater, the road is intact, the bodies are also intact with only gunshot injuries and blood. In airstrikes using bombs and missiles, the impacted area is destroyed, the entire area is covered by dust and debris, and the bodies are victims are blown up or badly damaged severed body parts.But there was nothing like in that video, and is clear that the victims seen on the road were shot. Also, the bodies have clear signs of gunfire shots, including headshots, indicating the work of snippers.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

70,"3 November, 2023 ","Maharashtra: Salman praises Tipu Sultan, shows Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj bowing before the Islamic tyrant, booked"," As per the FIR filed in the case, a man named Salman lavished praises on Islamic tyrant Tipu Sultan and showed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj bowing down in front of him, sparking outrage in Maharashtra's Sangli district. Recently, Maharashtra Police booked a person identified as Salman (full name unknown) for hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus and the Maratha community by posting ill photographs against Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on Instagram. The accused had posted a video on 19th October praising Tipu Sultan, the Islamic tyrant who slaughtered the Hindus of Malabar and Kodagu, killed and converted lakhs of them. The post also showed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj bowing and joining hands in request before the Islamist tyrant. The video and the FIR lodged in the case have been obtained by OpIndia. In the video, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the pride of Maharashtra and the Maratha community could be seen bowing in front of Tipu Sultan. The incident is said to have happened in the Sangli district of Maharashtra. FIR has been filed at Jat Police Station in Sangli.

In the complaint, Salunkhe mentioned that he was informed by one of his uncles about the video. Later on, verifying the reel, it was discovered that it was posted by Salman on his Instagram account having ID salman_sheikh.792.

72,"1 November, 2023 ","Who is Mr FAFO? The ‘Pallywood’ actor from Gaza who is a radiologist one day, air strike victim the next, and a dead body sometimes"," Saleh Aljafarawi claims to be a Palestinian national and a resident of Gaza. Infamous as ""Mr FAFO"", the 25-year-old ""Pallywood"" actor is the newly created social media portmanteau combining Palestine and Hollywood to make Pallywood, often makes videos to manipulate public sentiments and garner sympathy for Palestine and Hamas.Amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, a ‘crisis actor’ from Gaza has become a viral meme on social media for his videos featuring him in various roles ranging from a singer, a radiologist, an air strike victim, a media person to whatnot. The video content creator Saleh Aljafarawi has earned the moniker “Mr FAFO” online after a video of him rejoicing over Hamas airstrikes and later crying over Israeli retaliation went viral online.Saleh Aljafarawi claims to be a Palestinian national and a resident of Gaza. Infamous as “Mr FAFO”, the 25-year-old “Pallywood” actor is the newly created social media portmanteau combining Palestine and Hollywood to make Pallywood, often makes videos to manipulate public sentiments and garner sympathy for Palestine and Hamas. The Hamas actor is regularly peddling victimhood for Gaza to turn the narrative in favour of Palestine and justify Hamas’s onslaught against Israel.On X (formerly Twitter), many social media users highlighted Saleh Aljafarawi alias Mr FAFO’s ‘unparalleled’ acting skills. The Palestinian YouTuber has become a war meme.In one such X post by “King of Israel”, Mr FAFO is seen posing in an army uniform and singing a song while a Palestinian and Hamas flag is seen in the background.The video was posted by Aljafarawi in July this year on Instagram who claims to be a singer on YouTube channel. Mr FAFO’s singing talent also caught the attention of social media users as one Eli David posted, “who was a radiologist earlier today, is now a singer.”🚨 Breaking: #MrFAFO who was a radiologist earlier today, is now a singer 🎶Never seen someone so talented… pic.twitter.com/PjhZbvNEMyThe second image is the popular “F%$k around, find out” meme which got Aljafarawi the name “Mr FAFO”.

Also, someone needs to update the Hamas Health Ministry, that it’s 7,998 deaths because they counted #MrFAFO twice,” an X user posted.Did you know that #MrFAFO is also a reporter extraordinaire? #Pallywood Also someone need to update the Hamas Health Ministry, that it’s 7,998 deaths, because they counted #MrFAFO twice. https://t.co/ABGBHp0kyn pic.twitter.com/Q75wqfwu29Outlining Saleh Aljafarawi’s ‘acting skills’, author Oli London posted, “Hamas Crisis actor spotted with his Film Crew in Gaza preparing for his next role.

His main Instagram account was suspended by META… pic.twitter.com/0znaYppKSiIt is worth noting that Aljafarawi’s Instagram page was suspended recently, however, the page seems to have been restored. Mr FAFO reminds one of the “ghost of Kyiv” that gained popularity last year amidst the Ukraine-Russia war. The alleged flying hero was accredited with shooting down 40 Russian warplanes, however, it later turned out that the MiG-29 pilot aka “ghost of Kyiv” was not a real person but a mythical legend created by the Ukrainians and abetted by the Ukrainian Businessman Petro Poroshenko, who had posted a masked image of the “ghost of Kyiv” in February last year, hailing his six ‘imaginary’ victories over Russian pilots.На фото – пілот МіГ-29. Той самий «Привид Києва». Він викликає жах у ворогів та гордість в українців 🇺🇦 На його рахунку 6 перемог над російськими пілотами! З такими потужними захисниками Україна точно переможе! pic.twitter.com/GJLpcJ31SiNotably, certain claims associated with some of Mr FAFO’s videos have turned out to be misleading as well. For instance, the assertion that Saleh Aljafarawi recently became a father was misleading as in his original Instagram post, the ‘crisis actor’ did not make any such claim. Moreover, a video of an intubated patient on a hospital bed went viral online with a claim that it was Saleh Aljafarawi aka Mr FAFO posing as an airstrike victim. Although the striking similarity in looks of the person in the video confused many, he was not Aljafarawi but a Palestinian refugee at Nur Shams camp in the West Bank.Amidst Saleh Aljafarawi alias Mr FAFO’s desperate manipulations and misleading videos and social media claims, it is worth noting that Hamas has been employing various propaganda tactics to garner sympathy and project Israel as an oppressor. One such shameful gimmick by Hamas was when it claimed that over 500 died in the Gaza Hospital, however, officials from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) were quick to point out that this was not an Israeli airstrike but rather a misfired rocket from within Gaza. Apparently, in addition to the war against Hamas, Houthis and Hezbollah, Israel has to fight the mis/disinformation war as well.While Hamas and its propagandists are leaving no stone unturned to attract global sympathy and support against Israel, claiming to be victims of the Jewish nation’s offensive, senior Hamas terrorist official Ghazi Hamad not only justified the horrifying terror attack in Israel on October 7 killing 1,400 civilians including children and the elderly and raping women but also announced to repeat it until Israel’s annihilation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

73,"3 November, 2023 ","Afghan refugees deported from Pakistan: How Taliban, once propped up by Islamabad, has come back to bite it"," An estimated 1.7 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan are forced to leave their decades-old home after Islamabad begun a nationwide crackdown on foreign nationals it says are in the country illegally.Pakistan is deporting nearly 2 million Afghan refugees, many of whom have been residing in the country for over 30 years. Many of these Afghan migrants arrived in Pakistan after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979, then in the late 1990s when the Taliban first came to power and more recently in 2021, when the Taliban assumed control of the country.Besides citing economic concerns, the ISI-controlled Pakistan establishment has accused Afghan refugees of terrorist attacks, street crimes and organised crime like drug trafficking.What’s chilling is the fact that Pakistan is sending Afghan refugees – who escaped the Taliban rule, back to Afghanistan when it has been involved in the creation of the radical Islamist group. The Taliban has now come back to haunt Pakistan even as Afghan refugees pay the price.The word Taliban translates to “students” in Pashto language. The group came into existence in the early 1990s in northern Pakistan after the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan. Several Afghans who joined the Taliban were known to have received madrassa education in Pakistan.The head of the new Taliban government formed in 2021 in Afghanistan, Mohammad Hasan Akhund, who is also on the UN sanctions list, had studied at a seminary in Pakistan.Pakistan is known to be the Taliban’s principal benefactor and one of the only three countries that recognised the Taliban when they first took power in Afghanistan. The other two countries were Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pakistan was also the last country to break diplomatic ties with the Taliban after the US invaded Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks.Pakistan had not only trained armed mujahideen to fight the invading Soviet forces in Afghanistan but also helped facilitate the transition of a ragtag militia group into the Taliban, which later went on to lay control of the country from 1996 to 2001.Taliban became Pakistan’s link to terrorist outfits in central Asia like Al Qaeda. In return, the Taliban received cash incentives, arms and ammunition, and an unfettered passage through the porous borders between the two countries. Pakistan became a hideout for Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists who were being chased by US-led NATO forces.Pakistan also threw open Military hospitals to treat the Taliban terrorists who got wounded in their guerrilla war in Afghanistan or while crossing the border. Al Qaeda terrorist Osama Bin Laden’s refuge in the Pakistani backwater town of Abbottabad was a testimony to Islamabad’s resolute support of terrorism and its willingness to provide sanctuary to UN-designated terrorists and terror groups.Even as the Western forces were busy routing the Taliban from Afghanistan, Islamabad, on the other hand, was occupied in the rehabilitation of the group. They provided assistance to sustain the Taliban, even as the terror outfit lost thousands of foot soldiers against the NATO forces.Several US intelligence agencies and defence experts have been cautioning the USA against Pakistan, warning them that Islamabad’s interests were in conflict with the United States and that it was playing a dangerous double game, falsely claiming to help the United States in its war on terror while clandestinely extending moral, emotional and tactical support to the Taliban.While Pakistan was falsely claiming to cooperate with the US and the NATO forces in combating the Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorist groups, it was faced with a homegrown demon, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Like the Taliban, the TTP too, was nurtured by Pakistan when it could no more aid the Taliban directly owing to US operations in Afghanistan.The TTP was Pakistan’s medium of assistance to the Afghan Taliban from its own soil until it came to bite Pakistan back.The TTP came into being after 9/11 but became fully active after the Lal Masjid siege in Islamabad in July 2007. 13 radical and extremist terrorist groups within Pakistan united to form the TTP in an undisclosed place in South Waziristan Agency of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).The group’s objective was to fight the NATO forces in Afghanistan and wage a “defensive jihad” against Pakistani forces. It aimed to eradicate Islamabad’s influence in FATA and neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province in Pakistan, implementation of a strict Sharia in Pakistan and the expulsion of the coalition troops from Afghanistan.On 23rd November 2008, the then TTP spokesman, Mullah Omer, had reportedly said, “The Taliban are present in Karachi and have links with the LeJ, Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and other banned religious organisations.” The TTP is also known to have links with Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM), HuM and Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami (HuJI).Media reports on 5th January 2011, indicated that five terrorist groups had joined the TTP and were working under its umbrella TTP namely LeJ, SSP, JeM, HuM and Harkat-ul-Ansar (HuA). TTP spokesman Azam Tariq declared, “We have not forced anyone to join TTP, and the leaders and activists of the banned religious organisations have united themselves under the umbrella of the TTP on their own choice.”Pakistan Taliban is responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan, which the latter uses to victimise itself when it is responsible, directly or indirectly, for its creation.Despite being backed by the Afghan Taliban, Pakistan, which decries TTP terror attacks on its soil, celebrated and even played a role in the return of the Taliban. After the Taliban’s return in August 2021, the TTP, equipped with more arms and ammunition, has perpetrated back-to-back terrorist attacks in Pakistan.At least nine soldiers were killed and 20 others were critically injured in a terror attack in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. The incident took place in the Bannu district when a suicide bomber exploded himself. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), according to the military, was responsible for the terror strike.A blast took place inside the Peshawar Police Lines mosque resulting in the death of at least 28 people. Around 150 were reportedly injured in the blast. Shortly after the attack, the Islamist terror outfit Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the bombing.TTP reportedly claimed responsibility for killing six Pakistani security personnel and injuring others in several attacks in the Balochistan province. It must be mentioned that ISIS-Khorasan owes its existence to the TTP. ISIS-K was formed by disaffected TTP terrorists, thanks to Pakistan.No matter what Pakistan says, it cannot hide its true face and run away from its true identity, that of a terrorist state. Despite the TTP’s dance of death, Pakistan celebrated the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan even as the TTP had announced in 2020 that Pakistan was its agenda.In 2021, the TTP had warned Islamabad to brace itself for an attack by come Taliban in Afghanistan. But the then Pakistan PM Imran Khan was heard praising the Taliban and called on the US for dialogue with the terrorist group. “Taliban are the best bet to take on Daesh,” the former Pakistani cricketer had said.In August 2021, After the Taliban called Pakistan their “second home”, then-Pakistani Minister Sheikh Rashid confessed on a TV show that the Imran Khan-led government has indeed been the custodian of Talibani leaders.“We are the custodians of Taliban leaders. We have taken care of them for long. They got shelter, education and a home in Pakistan. We have done everything for them,” declared RashidFoolishly counting on the Taliban to help combat the TTP threat, Pakistan had also decided to help the Afghan Taliban organise their army. A top-level Pakistan official revealed that the Pakistanis decided to send security and intelligence officials, including the head of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, to Afghanistan to help the Taliban reorganise their military.When the Taliban was being challenged by the National Resistance Forces in Panjshir Valley of Afghanistan, the Pakistani Air Force was providing the radical group with drones to bomb the Amrullah Saleh forces.US Defence Analyst Sarah Chayes in an interview with CNN on September 1, 2021, attributed the Taliban’s resurrection to the emotional and military support it received from Pakistan’s notorious intelligence agency ISI.Chayes said that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI used its resources cleverly to help topple the US-backed Ashraf Ghani government in Afghanistan.As mentioned above, the TTP has only been strengthened with the resurgence of the Afghan Taliban much to Pakistan’s distress. Pakistan has no one but itself to hold responsible what with planting the seeds of terrorism in its own soil and across the borders too.Despite Pakistan’s repeated plea to the Taliban government for assistance in combating the TTP, the Taliban has washed its hands off saying that Pakistan’s security problems are its own. But given the terrorist-backing state’s fundamental nature, it has chosen to target Afghan refugees for its variety of issues, most of which emanate from homegrown Islamic radicalism.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
